#    Schema validator in N3
#
#   There is not on the semantic web a single meaning of
# the term "schema valid", as one can make different choices
# about what information is used for validation, and what lengths
# are gone to to try to find inconsitencies. In general, one cannot
# for any set of rules, just prove that a document does not violate
# a given set of constraints.  However, we can set the bar at a
# particular height. For example
#  - Retrieve schemata for any namesapces used in the target
#  - apply a given set of rules (a certian limite number of times?)
#  - check the result has no inconsistencies.
#
# See schema-rules.n3
#
#  This file just filters out the error messages from everything else.
