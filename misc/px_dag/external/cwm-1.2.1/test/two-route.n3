#    Double conclusion test
#
#  I had/ve a problem that the engine would conclude a rule
# and add it to the store even though it matched one already there.
# This is a test case to get to the bottom of that one.
#
#  cwm double-concludion.n3 -size -rules -size -rules -size
#
# should show the store not growing after the first application of the rules.
