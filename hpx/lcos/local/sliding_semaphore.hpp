    /// A semaphore is a protected variable (an entity storing a value) or
    /// abstract data type (an entity grouping several variables that may or
    /// may not be numerical) which constitutes the classic method for
    /// restricting access to shared resources, such as shared memory, in a
    /// multiprogramming environment. Semaphores exist in many variants, though
    /// usually the term refers to a counting semaphore, since a binary
    /// semaphore is better known as a mutex. A counting semaphore is a counter
    /// for a set of available resources, rather than a locked/unlocked flag of
    /// a single resource. It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra. Semaphores are
    /// the classic solution to preventing race conditions in the dining
    /// philosophers problem, although they do not prevent resource deadlocks.
    ///
    /// Sliding semaphores can be used for synchronizing multiple threads as
    /// well: one thread waiting for several other threads to touch (signal)
    /// the semaphore, or several threads waiting for one other thread to touch
    /// this semaphore. The difference to a counting semaphore is that a
    /// sliding semaphore will not limit the number of threads which are
    /// allowed to proceed, but will make sure that the difference between
    /// the (arbitrary) number passed to set and wait does not exceed a given
