    /// The \a full_empty data type is a implementation of memory areas guarded
    /// by full/empty bits, a very low level synchronization primitive. The
    /// class has been modeled after the FEB implementation in the QThread
    /// library (see here: http://www.cs.sandia.gov/qthreads/).
    ///
    /// All member functions but \a set_empty and \a set_full have the potential
    /// of blocking until the corresponding precondition is met. Memory is
    /// assumed to be full unless otherwise asserted, and as such memory that
    /// is full and does not have dependencies (i.e. no threads are waiting for
    /// it to become empty) does not require state data to be stored. It is
    /// expected that while there may be locks instantiated at one time or
    /// another for a very large number of addresses in the system, relatively
    /// few will be in a non-default (full, no waiters) state at any one time.
    ///
    /// The main idea is, that a memory location can be either empty or full.
    /// setting or writing a value to a location sets it to full. Reading from
    /// a location retrieves the value and (optionally) sets it to empty. A
    /// write will block if the location is full and will wait for it to become
    /// empty. If several write's are waiting for a location to become empty
    /// only one thread will be re-activated the moment it gets empty. A read
    /// will block if the location is empty and will wait for it to become
    /// full. If several read's are waiting for a location to become full
    /// all threads will be re-activated the moment it gets full.
    ///
    /// full_empty memory locations are very useful for synchronization and
    /// data delivery (especially in producer/consumer scenarios).
    ///
    /// If a full_empty memory location goes out of scope while reads/writes are
    /// waiting on it, those operations will be resumed immediately, and they
    /// either throw a \a hpx#yield_aborted exception or set their
    /// \a hpx#error_code parameter to \a hpx#yield_aborted.
    ///
    /// \tparam T   The template parameter \a T defines the type of the memory
    ///             location to be guarded by an empty/full bit. It is possible
    ///             to use any C++ data type with the empty/full mechanism.
    ///             If you want to use the empty/full synchronization facilities
    ///             without having to transfer (read/write) any data you can
    ///             use the specialization lcos#full_empty<void>.
