@section todo_implementation Implementation


- @c normal         destination::stream_ptr - just like stream, but hold the stream as a shared pointer. Thus , we won't have to worry
                    about outliving the stream.

- @c normal         make it possible to initialize from a file - thus we'd need no caching!
                    also allow for extra syntax for the named_writer - {} - to be applied to a destination
                    this way, you can specify some extra formatters to be applied only to a specific destination

- @c normal         on_dedicated_thead - remove dependency on boost::thread

- @c normal         on_dedicated_thead - I should see it I use logger::always_accurate increases logging time as opposed to some caching strategy.
                    I'm asking this because even if we were to use a critical section on the base_type writer's operator(), this will
                    *always* happen on the dedicated thread. Thus, I would think it should have very small overhead

- @c normal         must have helper to call on on_destructed - like, to be able to write to cout,etc

- @c normal         turn_cache_off() -> find better name, like mark_init_complete()  (add a function named like this to call turn_cache_off()).

- @c normal         have a logger_with_filter class, to make using the lib easier (this would hold the logger and the filter).

- @c high           destination::stream - have flush() and flush_each_time

- @c high           writer::named_write<> need to allow tags by default, here!

- @c high           scenario::use class - have ::gather and ::write typedefs !!!
                    this way we can have: named_logger< finder::gather , writer::named<finder::writer> >
                    same goes for logger_format_write class.

- @c normal         make it so that I use HPX_LOG_USE_WCHAR_T as little as possible
                    for instance, it's not needed in cout_t, cerr_t.

- @c high           cut down compile time: make it compile faster (most likely improve use_format_write, etc)

- @c high           named_write<> - due to @ref known_issue_modifying_manipulator - whenever I modify the format and/or destination string,
                    i need to add/delete all formatters and/or destinations in order to avoid that scenario TOTHINK

- @c high           logger_format_write<> should be just like other find classes - have logger_format_write<>::type
                    this should uncomplicate code a bit - at least specializing logger_to_gather/writer for logger_format_write<>. \n
                    I will first need to see if this will cut down compilation time or not.

- @c normal         profiler - we can care about threads as well (that is, for instance, when logging on another thread, see how much time
                    it takes from the threads that actually work)

- @c low            in the same way I've created convert_to_base(), I can create a convert_to_top(), on top of which
                    I can create my own way to gather message, and then write it.

- @c low            when leaking/not leaking loggers/using after_destroyed - have a templated class that allows this
                    (only if users ask for it)
                    I could probably do a bit more about caching as well - however, in this case, I should allow
                    for macros to be visible in client code (for instance, if client wants HPX_LOG_BEFORE_INIT_USE_CACHE_FILTER)

- @c high           test TSS on vs2003 and gcc/pthreads \n
  (note: tested on pthreads; however - about internal implementation : 2 TSS objects are leaked on pthreads, need to see why)

- @c normal         allow to see how much time logging actually takes \n
  This should work even if logging happens on a dedicated thread. Give a name to your tracker - so you can track logging time when messages are logged,
  and time logging actually happens (on dedicated thread).
  I should feature this on the documentation - I don't think any other lib has this! I should be able to add this for filter as well.

- @c low            configuration :  should allow the library to be configured at runtime, from a file, much like log4j
                    note: see formatter::named_spacer, destination::named
  - Votes : 1

- @c low      hierarchical logs : just like log4j - be able to have some logs inherit from parent logs
  I can implement this in multiple ways - one would be to use function names (BOOST_CURRENT_FUNCTION)
  and see the namespace/class name from there. Or, I could implement it using __FILE__.
  - Votes: 1

- @c low            have a "class"/"function" filter \n - so basically you can have is_enabled(this), which will call
  is_enabled<some_type>, which you can later on, or at runtime, enable or disable.
  --> turn on/off based on class name (typeid(name).string() - could be problematic in case the names are cryptic.
  What i can do is register some classes - with their name, so that you have a one-to-one corresp.
  you can even enforce a class to register its name TOTHINK \n
  note: this can be viewed as a hierarchical filter. In the same way, I could create a hierarchical logger (that is, find the logger,
  based on __FILE__ or __FUNCTION__)
  \n Implementation details: \n
  have a filter based on file name (the __FILE__) - should use TSS. comparing is very simple and efficient.
  std::map<const char*,bool, char_cmp>; \n
  std::map<std::string,bool> enabled; \n
  -- the idea is that a __FILE__ is a const char* and will always have the same (pointer) value. So once I know if it's enabled or not,
  it'll always be like that. once specifically turned on/off - we update the 2 maps

- @c low            composite_filter \n I want to allow an and_filter = filter1 && filter2, and an or_filter = filter1 || filter2.
  to see how I can find out if such a filter is enabled or not - for instance, receive 2 args = pass 1 to filter1 and 2 to filter2;
  or if get only one arg, you need to specify to whom to pass to

- @c low            Design: logged assert. I believe log library needs to provide support for custom assert.
  Such assert would log into log file and invoke system assert depends in assert level. It could be an addon to core functionality. \n
  Note: SMART_ASSERT should be used for this.

- @c normal           Allow using log from DLL and EXE (on Windows). Same for Linux. This should normally work - just need to explain how.


@section todo_formatters Formatters


- @c low    new formatter: limit the text to gives maximal length. It may happend the dump is unexpectedly large and would
  fill disk/overwrite cache/take too much time/be unreadable. Limiting one log size would help here a lot and would relieve end user of doing it manually.

- @c normal           quite often I am not interested not in absolute time (2005/12/11 16:33) but in time offset from some event.
  I suggest to add API: \n
  some_formatter.set_time_start_point( bool either_in_all_threads_or_just_in_current_thread); \n
  and escape sequences: \n
  $Xms   - e.g. "12 ms", "78321 ms" (only milliseconds are used) \n
  $Xsec  - e.g. "2 s, 23 ms" (only seconds and millis) \n
  $Xmin  - e.g. "3 m, 21 s, 10 ms" \n
  $Xhour - e.g. "1 h, 33 m, 20 s, 54 ms" \n
  $Xday  - e.g. "2 d, 1 h, 33 m, 20 s, 54 ms" \n

- @c normal           new formatter: thread ID (both Win32 and POSIX) is of low use. I suggest to add API to specify string name as alternative to thread ID
   formatter.set_current_thread_name("gui thread");

- @c normal           Time string cashing time and time_strf calls are not cashed. It's a lot of work for nothing. Note: should use TSS

- @c normal         Design: hexdump. I believe log library needs to provide support for dumping memory in hex format on log file.


@section todo_destinations Destinations

- @c normal         new destination : to Event log

- @c normal         shared_memory is to use interprocess lib.



@section todo_docs Documentation

- @c low            add "for documentation, see http://www.boost.org/lib/logging/" to each file

- @c low            have a document with differences from v1 and v2
  - Votes: 1

- @c normal         explain HPX_LOG_USE_SIMPLE_LOG_IF_FILTER (defining_logger_macros)

- @c normal         explain about cachestring clases

- @c normal         about is_generic formatters/destinations (note that I might have already written about this)

- @c low            Nice to have docs wish: a page discussing stranghts of this logger vs other common ones (log4cpp etc).

- @c normal         Documentation about performance of the library is missing - absolute times, # of dynamic allocations per typical log, etc.

- @c high           For formatters/destinations - make it easier to see - not necessary from examples.
                    By looking at the namespace itself, it contains other stuff as well. See if I can use @ ingroup or something

- @c normal         Explain about config files - you can use named_spacer,named.

- @c high           explain about common_base()

- @c high           on_dedicated_thread : explain about manipulating it - while pause() TOTHINK if I can automate this

- @c normal         "Manipulating thy manipulator" - another way is to create another manipulator, delete the current one , and add the new one
                    i should explain that this could not work immediately because of caching.

- @c normal         scoped logs - scoped_write_msg - explain that you need to implement this in case you have your own gather.read_msg().out() class
