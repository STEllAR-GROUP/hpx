@section changelog_cur_ver Current Version: v0.22.8, 4 feb 2008
- added license to all .h .cpp files (in scenarios/tests - they were missing)
- removed loggingvc8.cpp file (useless)
- lib -> libs
- doxygen.txt -> [lib -> libs]

- v0.22.7 - the version that is Boost Reviewed
- updated batches for building with bjam
- made mul_levels_mul_logers run successfully on Fedora8
- ts_posix.hpp - use BOOST_ASSERT instead of assert
- solved bug in using_tags - delete_array used after logger destroyed
- solved bug in no_levels_with_route - care about formatter::spacer
- solved gcc warning - m_writer initialized before m_original_logger
- fixed issue in Jamfile.v2 - runtime-link should refer only to msvc

v0.21.13, 1 feb 2008
- added known_issues section
- added getting_started section
- fixed scoped logs and added test
- added test_on_dedicated_thread
- updated Jamfile.v2 files for examples and test, for them to compile all files tests/examples
- updated Jamfile.v2 to actually build the tests + the tests to use BOOST_CHECK
- updated docs : about caching/destruction
- not using after_being_destroyed.hpp anymore - no need (see @ref after_destruction).
- made it much easier to include Boost Logging Lib headers: format_fwd.hpp, named_write_fwd.hpp, which internally accomodate for slow compilation
  (that is, even if slow compile, you won't need to include more headers in your your_app_log.h file)
- updated docs + named_writer -> named_write
- now can include <hpx/util/logging/format.hpp> without including format_fwd.hpp before, and use BOOST_LOG* macros, and code still compiles and works as expected
- moved tags.hpp - not to be included directly by mistake
- added HPX_LOG_DONOT_USE_WCHAR_T for Windows users
- added more docs to named_logger
- added named_logger - much easier to use the logging lib - doesn't require any advanced knowledge at all
- simplified examples, removed some of them from the "Scenarios" page; they're still found in the "Examples" section in the docs
- should only fix bugs & update docs until review

v0.20.16, 21 jan 2008
- docs about using loggers/filters are they were destroyed
- more docs about @ref defining_your_logger_filter
- added example using profiling, @ref common_scenario_profile "see it"
- refactored finding the writer; added logger_to_writer class
- fully implemented profiling
- added logger_to_gather, removed DEFINE_GATHER_CLASS;
- modified compile_time example, to see compile time with precompiled header
- added profiler - allow profiling the logging code
- solved bug in logger_holder_by_value - many thanks to Olaf!
- refactored logger_holder - that is, we need to return logger_holder,
  but keep logger_holder_by_value, for after_destroyed to work
- added test for using logger after it's been destroyed
- handle using logger after it's been destroyed
- simpler version of logger (derive from logger_base)
- added dll_and_exe - show how you can use a logger that is defined in a DLL, and use it from an EXE
- explained the breaking change in the docs
- updated the tests to compile (after the breaking change)
- @ref breaking_change_v_20 "BREAKING CHANGE" : when you use the filters/loggers, use them as function names (append "()" to them)
  - Please take a look at the updated examples or at the online help. Thanks for understanding.

- we have hpx::util::logging::scenario namespace, which finds the right filter/logger, based on your application's needs

v0.10.12, 8 nov 2007

- added scenario.hpp + documentation for it

- moved changelog.hpp to detail/raw_doc dir

v0.9.11, 31 oct 2007
- no more stdafx.* files

v0.9.10, 31 oct 2007
- destination::file - on linux don't add ios_base::in when not original overwrite. Many thanks to Martin Baeker!

v0.9.9, 31 oct 2007
- fixed fastest*.cpp scenarios so that they compile. Many thanks to Martin Baeker!

v0.9.8, 31 oct 2007
- added small things to make it compile with gcc 4.1 and 4.3
  (note: I just solved some errors that were pointed out by Jens Seidel, not sure if this fixed everything)

v0.9.7, 30 oct 2007
- added small things to make it compile with gcc 4.1 and 4.3
  (note: I just solved some errors that were pointed out by Jens Seidel, not sure if this fixed everything)

v0.9.6, 30 oct 2007
- removed garbage from stdafx.h files - so that it can be compiled under Linux

v0.9.5, 30 oct 2007
- compiles with gcc 4.1 and 4.3
  (note: I just solved some errors that were pointed out by Jens Seidel, not sure if this fixed everything)

v0.9.4, 30 oct 2007
- compiles with gcc 3.4.2

v0.9.3, 30 oct 2007
- updated documentation
    - updated workflow/most of the pages in the table of contents
    - removed most of references to @c process_msg class

v0.9.2, 30 oct 2007
- Breaking chage:
  - @c process_msg class has been removed. Now @c logger takes its place
  - Instead of logger<use_format_write<>>, use logger_format_write<>

v0.9.1, 30 oct 2007
- implemented HPX_DEFINE_LOG/HPX_DECLARE_LOG for when not compiling fast
- BEFORE a breaking change that will happen :
  - logger as is now will dissapear
  - the new logger class will be the old process_msg class


v0.9.0, 28 oct 2007
- use_format_write has 4 params now, I've added 2 new params: thread_safety and gather
  - if you want to leave something unchanged, use "default_" as argument
- added more complex example: Line Counter application
- Breaking change:
  - filters are declared with HPX_DECLARE_LOG_FILTER, and defined with HPX_DEFINE_LOG_FILTER
  - filters are now used with operator->, instead of "."
  - Example:
		HPX_DEFINE_LOG_LEVEL(g_log_level(), level::holder )
		...
		g_log_level()->set_enabled(level::error);
  - rationale: filters, same as levels, could be used before main

- updated documentation


v0.8.2, 22 oct 2007
- added one more common scenario (with_route)
