# HPX_WITH_CXX_STANDARD (or CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD in conjunction with
# HPX_USE_CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=ON) that requirement has to be propagated to users
# of HPX as well (i.e. HPX can't be compiled with C++20 and applications with
# C++17; the other way around is allowed). Ideally, users should not set
# CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD when building HPX.
