# Locate the Vc template library. Vc can be found at
# https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc
#
# This file is meant to be copied into projects that want to use Vc. It will
# search for VcConfig.cmake, which ships with Vc and will provide up-to-date
# buildsystem changes. Thus there should not be any need to update FindVc.cmake
# again after you integrated it into your project.

# This module defines the following variables: Vc_FOUND Vc_INCLUDE_DIR
# Vc_LIBRARIES Vc_DEFINITIONS Vc_COMPILE_FLAGS Vc_ARCHITECTURE_FLAGS
# Vc_ALL_FLAGS (the union of the above three variables) Vc_VERSION_MAJOR
# Vc_VERSION_MINOR Vc_VERSION_PATCH Vc_VERSION Vc_VERSION_STRING Vc_INSTALL_DIR
# Vc_LIB_DIR Vc_CMAKE_MODULES_DIR

# The following two variables are set according to the compiler used. Feel free
# to use them to skip whole compilation units. Vc_SSE_INTRINSICS_BROKEN
