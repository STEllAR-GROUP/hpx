|cmake| toolchains shipped with |hpx|
=====================================

In order to compile |hpx| for various platforms, we provide a variety of toolchain
files that take care of setting up various |cmake| variables like compilers, etc.
They are located in the ``cmake/toolchains`` directory:

@HPX_CMAKE_TOOLCHAINS_LIST_RST@

To use them, pass the ``-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<toolchain>`` argument to the
CMake invocation.

@HPX_CMAKE_TOOLCHAINS_RST@
