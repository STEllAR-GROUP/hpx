<p>
      This section gives definitions for some of the terms used throughout the <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span>
      documentation and source code.
    </p>
<h4>
<a name="hpx.terminology.h0"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="hpx.terminology.locality"></a></span><a class="link" href="terminology.html#hpx.terminology.locality">Locality</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      A locality in <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> describes a synchronous domain of execution,
      or the domain of bounded upper response time. This normally is just a single
      node in a cluster or a NUMA domain in a SMP machine.
    </p>
<h4>
<a name="hpx.terminology.h1"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="hpx.terminology.agas"></a></span><a class="link" href="terminology.html#hpx.terminology.agas">Active
      Global Address Space (AGAS)</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> incorporates a global address space. Any executing
      thread can access any object within the domain of the parallel application
      with the caveat that it must have appropriate access privileges. The model
      does not assume that global addresses are cache coherent; all loads and stores
      will deal directly with the site of the target object. All global addresses
      within a Synchronous Domain are assumed to be cache coherent for those processor
      cores that incorporate transparent caches. The Active Global Address Space
      used by <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> differs from research <a href="http://www.pgas.org/" target="_top">PGAS</a>
      models. Partitioned Global Address Space is passive in their means of address
      translation. Copy semantics, distributed compound operations, and affinity
      relationships are some of the global functionality supported by AGAS.

<h4>
<a name="hpx.terminology.h2"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="hpx.terminology.process"></a></span><a class="link" href="terminology.html#hpx.terminology.process">Process</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      The concept of the "process" in <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> is extended
      beyond that of either sequential execution or communicating sequential processes.
      While the notion of process suggests action (as do "function" or
      "subroutine") it has a further responsibility of context, that is,
      the logical container of program state. It is this aspect of operation that
      process is employed in <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span>. Furthermore, referring to
      "parallel processes" in <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> designates the presence
      of parallelism within the context of a given process, as well as the coarse
      grained parallelism achieved through concurrency of multiple processes of an
      executing user job. <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> processes provide a hierarchical
      name space within the framework of the active global address space and support
      multiple means of internal state access from external sources. It also incorporates
      capabilities based access rights for protection and security.
    </p>
<h4>
<a name="hpx.terminology.h3"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="hpx.terminology.parcel"></a></span><a class="link" href="terminology.html#hpx.terminology.parcel">Parcel</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      The Parcel is a component in <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span> that communicates data,
      invokes an action at a distance, and distributes flow-control through the migration
      of continuations. Parcels bridge the gap of asynchrony between synchronous
      domains while maintaining symmetry of semantics between local and global execution.
      Parcels enable message-driven computation and may be seen as a form of "active
      messages". Other important forms of message-driven computation predating
      active messages include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_architecture" target="_top">dataflow
      tokens</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%E2%80%93Machine" target="_top">J-machine's</a>
      support for remote method instantiation, and at the coarse grained variations
      of Unix remote procedure calls, among others. This enables work to be moved
      to the data as well as performing the more common action of bringing data to
      the work. A parcel can cause actions to occur remotely and asynchronously,
      among which are the creation of threads at different system nodes or synchronous
      domains.
    </p>
<h4>
<a name="hpx.terminology.h4"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="hpx.terminology.lco"></a></span><a class="link" href="terminology.html#hpx.terminology.lco">Local
      Control Object (LCO)</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      A local control object (sometimes called a lightweight control object) is a
      general term for the synchronization mechanisms used in <span class="emphasis"><em>HPX</em></span>.
      Any object implementing a certain concept can be seen as an LCO. This concepts
      encapsulates the ability to be triggered by one or more events which when taking
      the object into a predefined state will cause a thread to be executed. This
      could either create a new thread or resume an existing thread.
    </p>
<p>
      The LCO is a family of synchronization functions potentially representing many
      classes of synchronization constructs, each with many possible variations and
      multiple instances. The LCO is sufficiently general that it can subsume the
      functionality of conventional synchronization primitives such as spinlocks,
      mutexes, semaphores, and global barriers. However due to the rich concept an
      LCO can represent powerful synchronization and control functionality not widely
      employed, such as dataflow and futures (among others), which open up enormous
      opportunities for rich diversity of distributed control and operation.
