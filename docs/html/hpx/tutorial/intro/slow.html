          Estimates say that we currently run our computers at way below 100% efficiency.
          The theoretical peak performance (usually measured in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS" target="_top">FLOPS</a>
          - floating point operations per second) is much higher than any practical
          peak performance reached by any application. This is particularly true
          for highly parallel hardware. The more hardware parallelism we provide
          to an application, the better the application must scale in order to efficiently
          use all the resources of the machine. Roughly speaking, we distinguish
          two forms of scalability: strong scaling (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_top">Amdahl's
          Law</a>) and weak scaling (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustafson%27s_law" target="_top">Gustafson's
          Law</a>). Strong scaling is defined as how the solution time varies
          with the number of processors for a fixed <span class="bold"><strong>total</strong></span>
          problem size. It gives an estimate of how much faster can we solve a particular
          problem by throwing more resources at it. Weak scaling is defined as how
          the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed problem
          size <span class="bold"><strong>per processor</strong></span>. In other words, it
          defines how much more data can we process by using more hardware resources.
        </p>
<p>
          In order to utilize as much hardware parallelism as possible an application
          must exhibit excellent strong and weak scaling characteristics, which requires
          a high percentage of work executed in parallel, i.e. using multiple threads
          of execution. Optimally, if you execute an application on a hardware resource
          with N processors it either runs N times faster or it can handle N times
          more data. Both cases imply 100% of the work is executed on all available
          processors in parallel. However, this is just a theoretical limit. Unfortunately,
          there are more things which limit scalability, mostly inherent to the hardware
          architectures and the programming models we use. We break these limitations
          into four fundamental factors which make our systems <span class="bold"><strong>SLOW</strong></span>:
        </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="bold"><strong>S</strong></span>tarvation</em></span> occurs
              when there is insufficient concurrent work available to maintain high
              utilization of all resources.
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="bold"><strong>L</strong></span>atencies</em></span> are
              imposed by the time-distance delay intrinsic to accessing remote resources
              and services.
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="bold"><strong>O</strong></span>verhead</em></span> is work
              required for the management of parallel actions and resources on the
              critical execution path which is not necessary in a sequential variant.
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="bold"><strong>W</strong></span>aiting</em></span> for contention
              resolution is the delay due to the lack of availability of oversubscribed
              shared resources.
            </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
          Each of those four factors manifests itself in multiple and different ways;
          each of the hardware architectures and programming models expose specific
          forms. However the interesting part is that all of them are limiting the
          scalability of applications no matter what part of the hardware jungle
          we look at. Hand-helds, PCs, supercomputers, or the cloud, all suffer from
          the reign of the 4 horsemen: <span class="bold"><strong>S</strong></span>tarvation,
          <span class="bold"><strong>L</strong></span>atency, <span class="bold"><strong>O</strong></span>verhead,
          and <span class="bold"><strong>C</strong></span>ontention. This realization is very
          important as it allows us to derive the criteria for solutions to the scalability
          problem from first principles, it allows us to focus our analysis on very
          concrete patterns and measurable metrics. Moreover, any derived results
          will be applicable to a wide variety of targets.
