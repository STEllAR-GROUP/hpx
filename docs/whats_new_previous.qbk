[//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////]
[section:hpx_0_9_99 __hpx__ V0.9.99 (Jul 15, 2016)]

[heading General Changes]

As the version number of this release hints, we consider this release
to be a preview
for the upcoming __hpx__ V1.0. All of the functionalities
we set out to implement for
V1.0 are in place; all of the features we wanted to have exposed are ready. We
are very happy with the stability and performance of __hpx__ and we would like
to present this release to the community in order for us to
gather broad feedback before releasing V1.0.
We still expect for some minor details to change, but
on the whole this release represents what we would like to have in a V1.0.

Overall, since the last release we have had almost 1600 commits while closing
almost 400 tickets. These numbers reflect the incredible development activity
we have seen over the last couple of months. We would like to express a big
'Thank you!' to all contributors and those who helped to make this release
happen.

The most notable addition in terms of new functionality available with this
release is the full implementation of object migration (i.e. the ability to
transparently move __hpx__ components to a different compute node).
Additionally, this release of __hpx__ cleans up many minor issues and some
API inconsistencies.

Here are some of the main highlights and changes for this release (in no
particular order):

* We have fixed a couple of issues in AGAS and the parcel layer which have
  caused hangs, segmentation faults at exit, and a slowdown of applications
  over time. Fixing those has significantly increased the overall stability
  and performance of distributed runs.
* We have started to add parallel algorithm overloads based on the C++
  Extensions for Ranges (__cpp17_n4560__) proposal. This also includes the
  addition of projections to the existing algorithms. Please see [issue 1668]
  for a list of algorithms which have been adapted to __cpp17_n4560__.
* We have implemented index-based parallel for-loops based on a
  corresponding standardization proposal (__cpp20_p0075r1__). Please see
  [issue 2016] for a list of available algorithms.
* We have added implementations for more parallel algorithms as proposed for
  the upcoming C++ 17 Standard. See [issue 1141] for an overview of which
  algorithms are available by now.
* We have started to implement a new prototypical functionality with
  __hpx_compute__ which uniformly exposes some of the higher level APIs to
  heterogeneous architectures (currently CUDA). This functionality is an early
  preview and should not be considered stable. It may change considerably in
  the future.
* We have pervasively added (optional) executor arguments to all API functions
  which schedule new work. Executors are now used throughout the code base as
  the main means of executing tasks.
* Added `hpx::make_future<R>(future<T> &&)` allowing to convert a future of
  any type `T` into a future of any other type `R`, either based on default
  conversion rules of the embedded types or using a given explicit conversion
  function.
* We finally finished the implementation of transparent migration of components
  to another locality. It is now possible to trigger
  a migration operation without 'stopping the world' for the object to migrate.
  __hpx__ will make sure that no work is being performed on an object before it
  is migrated and that all subsequently scheduled work for the migrated object
  will be transparently forwarded to the new locality. Please note that the
  global id of the migrated object does not change, thus the application will
  not have to be changed in any way to support this new functionality. Please
  note that this feature is currently considered experimental. See [issue 559]
  and [pr 1966] for more details.
* The `hpx::dataflow` facility is now usable with actions. Similarly to
  `hpx::async`, actions can be specified as an explicit template argument
  (`hpx::dataflow<Action>(target, ...)`) or as the first argument
  (`hpx::dataflow(Action(), target, ...)`). We have also enabled the use of
  distribution policies as the target for dataflow invocations. Please see
  [issue 1265] and [pr 1912] for more information.
* Adding overloads of `gather_here` and `gather_there` to accept the plain
  values of the data to gather (in addition to the existing overloads expecting
  futures).
* We have cleaned up and refactored large parts of the code base. This helped
  reducing compile and link times of __hpx__ itself and also of applications
  depending on it. We have further decreased the dependency of __hpx__ on the
  Boost libraries by replacing part of those with facilities available from the
  standard libraries.
* Wherever possible we have removed dependencies of our API on Boost by
  replacing those with the equivalent facility from the C++11 standard library.
* We have added new performance counters for parcel coalescing, file-IO, the
  AGAS cache, and overall scheduler time. Resetting performance counters has
  been overhauled and fixed.
* We have introduced a generic client type `hpx::components::client<>` and
  added support for using it with `hpx::async`. This removes the necessity to
  implement specific client types for every component type without losing
  type safety. This deemphasizes the need for using the low level `hpx::id_type`
  for referencing (possibly remote) component instances. The plan is to
  deprecate the direct use of `hpx::id_type` in user code in the future.
* We have added a special iterator which supports automatic prefetching of
  one or more arrays for speeding up loop-like code (see
  `hpx::parallel::util::make_prefetcher_context()`).
* We have extended the interfaces exposed from executors (as proposed by
  __cpp11_n4406__) to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.

[heading Breaking Changes]

* In order to move the dataflow facility to `namespace hpx` we added a
  definition of `hpx::dataflow` which might create ambiguities in existing
  codes. The previous definition of this facility (`hpx::lcos::local::dataflow`)
  has been deprecated and is available only if the constant
  `-DHPX_WITH_LOCAL_DATAFLOW_COMPATIBILITY=On` to __cmake __ is defined at
  configuration time.
  Please explicitly qualify all uses of the dataflow facility if you enable
  this compatibility setting and encounter ambiguities.
* The adaptation of the C++ Extensions for Ranges (__cpp17_n4560__) proposal
  imposes some breaking changes related to the return types of some of the
  parallel algorithms. Please see [issue 1668] for a list of algorithms which
  have already been adapted.
* The facility `hpx::lcos::make_future_void()` has been replaced by
  `hpx::make_future<void>()`.
* We have removed support for Intel V13 and gcc 4.4.x.
* We have removed (default) support for the generic
  `hpx::parallel::execution_poliy` because it was removed from the Parallelism
  TS (__cpp11_n4104__) while it was being added to the upcoming C++17 Standard.
  This facility can be still enabled at configure time by specifying
  `-DHPX_WITH_GENERIC_EXECUTION_POLICY=On` to __cmake__.
* Uses of `boost::shared_ptr` and related facilities have been replaced with
  `std::shared_ptr` and friends. Uses of `boost::unique_lock`,
  `boost::lock_guard` etc. have also been replaced by the equivalent (and
  equally named) tools available from the C++11 standard library.
* Facilities that used to expect an explicit `boost::unique_lock` now take an
  `std::unique_lock`. Additionally, `condition_variable` no longer aliases
  `condition_variable_any`; its interface now only works with
  `std::unique_lock<local::mutex>`.
* Uses of `boost::function`, `boost::bind`, `boost::tuple` have been replaced
  by the corresponding facilities in __hpx__ (`hpx::util::function`,
  `hpx::util::bind`, and `hpx::util::tuple`, respectively).

[//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////]
[section:hpx_0_9_11 __hpx__ V0.9.11 (Nov 11, 2015)]

Our main focus for this release was the design and development of a coherent
set of higher-level APIs exposing various types of parallelism to the
application programmer. We introduced the concepts of an `executor`, which can
be used to customize the `where` and `when` of execution of tasks in the
context of parallelizing codes. We extended all APIs related to managing parallel
tasks to support executors which gives the user the choce of either using
one of the predefined executor types or to provide its own, possibly application
specific, executor. We paid very close attention to align all of these changes
with the existing C++ Standards documents or with the ongoing proposals for
standardization.

This release is the first after our change to a new development policy. We
switched all development to be strictly performed on branches only, all direct
commits to our main branch (`master`) are prohibited. Any change has to go
through a peer review before it will be merged to `master`. As a result the
overall stability of our code base has significantly increased, the development
process itself has been simplified. This change manifests itself in a large
number of pull-requests which have been merged (please see below for a full list
of closed issues and pull-requests). All in all for this release, we closed
almost 100 issues and merged over 290 pull-requests. There have been over 1600
commits to the master branch since the last release.

[heading General Changes]

* We are moving into the direction of unifying managed and simple components. As
  such, the classes [classref hpx::components::component] and
  [classref hpx::components::component_base] have been added which currently just
  forward to the currently existing simple component facilities. The examples
  have been converted to only use those two classes.
* Added integration with the [@https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx CircleCI]
  hosted continuous integration service. This gives us constant and immediate
  feedback on the health of our master branch.
* The compiler configuration subsystem in the build system has been reimplemented.
  Instead of using Boost.Config we now use our own lightweight set of cmake
  scripts to determine the available language and library features supported by
  the used compiler.
* The API for creating instances of components has been consolidated. All
  component instances should be created using the [funcref hpx::new_ `hpx::new_<>()`]
  only. It allows to instantiate both, single component instances and multiple
  component instances. The placement of the created components can be controlled
  by special distribution policies. Please see the corresponding documentation
  outlining the use of [funcref hpx::new_ `hpx::new_<>()`].
* Introduced four new distribution policies which can be used with many API
  functions which traditionally expected to be used with a locality id. The
  new distribution policies are:
  * [classref hpx::components::default_distribution_policy `hpx::default_distribution_policy`]
    which tries to place multiple component instances as evenly as possible.
  * [classref hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy `hpx::colocating_distribution_policy`]
    which will refer to the locality where a given component instance is
    currently placed.
  * [classref hpx::components::binpacking_distribution_policy `hpx::binpacking_distribution_policy`]
    which will place multiple component instances as evenly as possible based
    on any performance counter.
  * [classref hpx::components::target_distribution_policy `hpx::target_distribution_policy`]
    which allows to represent a given locality in the context of a distrwibution
    policy.
* The new distribution policies can now be also used with `hpx::async`. This
  change also deprecates `hpx::async_colocated(id, ...)` which now is replaced
  by a distribution policy: `hpx::async(hpx::colocated(id), ...)`.
* The `hpx::vector` and `hpx::unordered_map` data structures can now be used
  with the new distribution policies as well.
* The parallel facility `hpx::parallel::task_region` has been renamed to
  [classref hpx::parallel::v2::task_block `hpx::parallel::task_block`] based on
  the changes in the corresponding standardization proposal __cpp11_n4088__.
* Added extensions to the parallel facility
  [classref hpx::parallel::v2::task_block `hpx::parallel::task_block`] allowing
  to combine a task_block with an execution policy. This implies a minor
  breaking change as the `hpx::parallel::task_block` is now a template.
* Added new LCOs: `hpx::lcos::latch` and `hpx::lcos::local::latch` which
  semantically conform to the proposed `std::latch` (see __cpp17_n4399__).
* Added performance counters exposing data related to data transferred by
  input/output (filesystem) operations (thanks to Maciej Brodowicz).
* Added performance counters allowing to track the number of action invocations
  (local and remote invocations).
* Added new command line options [hpx_cmdline `--hpx:print-counter-at`] and
  [hpx_cmdline `--hpx:reset-counters`].
* The `hpx::vector` component has been renamed to `hpx::partitioned_vector` to
  make it explicit that the underlying memory is not contiguous.
* Introduced a completely new and uniform higher-level parallelism API which is
  based on executors. All existing parallelism APIs have been adapted to this.
  We have added a large number of different executor types, such as a
  numa-aware executor, a this-thread executor, etc.
* Added support for the MingW toolchain on Windows (thanks to Eric Lemanissier).
* HPX now includes support for APEX, (Autonomic Performance Environment for
  eXascale). APEX is an instrumentation and software adaptation library that
  provides an interface to TAU profiling / tracing as well as runtime adaptation
  of HPX applications through policy definitions. For more information and
  documentation, please see https://github.com/khuck/xpress-apex. To enable
  APEX at configuration time, specify `-DHPX_WITH_APEX=On`. To also include
  support for TAU profiling, specify `-DHPX_WITH_TAU=On` and specify the
  `-DTAU_ROOT`, `-DTAU_ARCH` and `-DTAU_OPTIONS` cmake parameters.
* We have implemented many more of the
  [link hpx.manual.parallel.parallel_algorithms.parallel_algorithms parallel algorithms].
  Please see [issue 1141] for the list of all available parallel algorithms
  (thanks to Daniel Bourgeois and John Biddiscombe for contributing their work).

[heading Breaking Changes]

* We are moving into the direction of unifying managed and simple components. In
  order to stop exposing the old facilities, all examples have been converted to
  use the new classes. The breaking change in this release is that performance
  counters are now a [classref hpx::components::component_base] instead of
  [classref hpx::components::managed_component_base].
* We removed the support for stackless threads. It turned out that there was no
  performance benefit when using stackless threads. As such, we decided to clean
  up our codebase. This feature was not documented.
* The CMake project name has changed from 'hpx' to 'HPX' for consistency and
  compatibilty with naming conventions and other CMake projects. Generated
  config files go into <prefix>/lib/cmake/HPX and not <prefix>/lib/cmake/hpx.
* The macro `HPX_REGISTER_MINIMAL_COMPONENT_FACTORY` has been deprecated. Please
  use [macroref HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT `HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT`] instead.
  The old macro will be removed in the next release.
* The obsolete distributing_factory and binpacking_factory components have been
  removed. The corresponding functionality is now provided by the
  [funcref hpx::new_ `hpx::new_<>()`] API function in conjunction with the
  `hpx::default_layout` and `hpx::binpacking` distribution policies
  ([classref hpx::components::default_distribution_policy `hpx::default_distribution_policy`] and
  [classref hpx::components::binpacking_distribution_policy `hpx::binpacking_distribution_policy`])
* The API function `hpx::new_colocated` has been deprecated. Please use the
  consolidated API [funcref hpx::new_ `hpx::new_`] in conjunction with the new
  `hpx::colocated` distribution policy
  ([classref hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy `hpx::colocating_distribution_policy`])
  instead. The old API function will still be available for at least one
  release of __hpx__ if the configuration variable
  `HPX_WITH_COLOCATED_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY` is enabled.
* The API function `hpx::async_colocated` has been deprecated. Please use the
  consolidated API `hpx::async` in conjunction with the new `hpx::colocated`
  distribution policy
  ([classref hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy `hpx::colocating_distribution_policy`])
  instead. The old API function will still be available for
  at least one  release of __hpx__ if the configuration variable
  `HPX_WITH_COLOCATED_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY` is enabled.
* The obsolete remote_object component has been removed.
* Replaced the use of Boost.Serialization with our own solution. While the new
  version is mostly compatible with Boost.Serialization, this change requires
  some minor code modifications in user code. For more information, please see the
  corresponding [@http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.hpx.devel/196 announcement]
  on the __stellar_list__ mailing list.
* The names used by cmake to influence various configuration options have been
  unified. The new naming scheme relies on all configuration constants to start
  with `HPX_WITH_...`, while the preprocessor constant which is used at build
  time starts with `HPX_HAVE_...`. For instance, the former cmake command line
  `-DHPX_MALLOC=...` now has to be specified a `-DHPX_WITH_MALLOC=...` and will
  cause the preprocessor constant `HPX_HAVE_MALLOC` to be defined. The actual
  name of the constant (i.e. `MALLOC`) has not changed. Please see the
  corresponding documentation for more details (__cmake_options__).
* The `get_gid()` functions exposed by the component base classes
  `hpx::components::server::simple_component_base`,
  `hpx::components::server::managed_component_base`, and
  `hpx::components::server::fixed_component_base` have been replaced by two new
  functions: `get_unmanaged_id()` and `get_id()`. To enable the old function
  name for backwards compatibility, use the cmake configuration option
  `HPX_WITH_COMPONENT_GET_GID_COMPATIBILITY=On`.
* All functions which were named `get_gid()` but were returning `hpx::id_type`
  have been renamed to `get_id()`. To enable the old function names for
  backwards compatibility, use the cmake configuration option
  `HPX_WITH_COMPONENT_GET_GID_COMPATIBILITY=On`.

[section:hpx_0_9_10 __hpx__ V0.9.10 (Mar 24, 2015)]

[heading General Changes]

This is the 12th official release of __hpx__. It coincides with the 7th
anniversary of the first commit to our source code repository. Since then,
we have seen over 12300 commits amounting to more than 220000 lines of C++ code.

The major focus of this release was to improve the reliability of large scale
runs. We believe to have achieved this goal as we now can reliably run __hpx__
applications on up to ~24k cores. We have also shown that HPX can be used with
success for symmetric runs (applications using both, host cores and Intel
Xeon/Phi coprocessors). This is a huge step forward in terms of
the usability of __hpx__. The main focus of this work involved isolating
the causes of the segmentation faults at start up and shut down.  Many of
these issues were discovered to be the result of the suspension of threads
which hold locks.

A very important improvement introduced with this release is the
refactoring of the code representing our parcel-port implementation. Parcel-
ports can now be implemented by 3rd parties as independent plugins which are
dynamically loaded at runtime (static linking of parcel-ports is also
supported). This refactoring also includes a massive improvement of the
performance of our existing parcel-ports. We were able to significantly reduce
the networking latencies and to improve the available networking bandwidth.
Please note that in this release we disabled the ibverbs and ipc parcel ports
as those have not been ported to the new plugin system yet (see [issue 839]).

Another corner stone of this release is our work towards a complete
implementation of __cpp11_n4104__ (Working Draft, Technical Specification for
C++ Extensions for Parallelism). This document defines a set of parallel
algorithms to be added to the C++ standard library.
We now have implemented about 75% of all specified parallel algorithms (see
[link hpx.manual.parallel.parallel_algorithms Parallel Algorithms] for more
details). We also implemented some extensions to __cpp11_n4104__ allowing to
invoke all of the algorithms asynchronously.

This release adds a first implementation of `hpx::vector` which is a distributed
data structure closely aligned to the functionality of `std::vector`. The
difference is that `hpx::vector` stores the data in partitions where the
partitions can be distributed over different localities. We started to work on
allowing to use the parallel algorithms with `hpx::vector`. At this point we have
implemented only a few of the parallel algorithms to support distributed data
structures (like `hpx::vector`) for testing purposes (see [issue 1338] for
a documentation of our progress).

[heading Breaking Changes]

With this release we put a lot of effort into changing the code base to be more
compatible to C++11. These changes have caused the following issues for
backward compatibility:

* Move to Variadics- All of the API now uses variadic templates. However, this
change required to modify the argument sequence for some of the exiting API
functions ([funcref hpx::async_continue `hpx::async_continue`],
[funcref hpx::apply_continue `hpx::apply_continue`],
[funcref hpx::when_each `hpx::when_each`],
[funcref hpx::wait_each `hpx::wait_each`], synchronous invocation of actions).

* Changes to Macros- We also removed the macros `HPX_STD_FUNCTION` and
`HPX_STD_TUPLE`.
This shouldn't affect any user
code as we replaced `HPX_STD_FUNCTION` with `hpx::util::function_nonser` which
was the default expansion used for this macro. All __hpx__ API functions which
expect a `hpx::util::function_nonser` (or a `hpx::util::unique_function_nonser`)
can now be transparently called with a compatible `std::function` instead.
Similarly, `HPX_STD_TUPLE` was replaced by its default expansion as well:
`hpx::util::tuple`.

* Changes to `hpx::unique_future`- `hpx::unique_future`, which was deprecated
in the previous release for
[funcref hpx::future `hpx::future`] is now completely removed from __hpx__.
This completes the transition to a completely standards conforming
implementation of `hpx::future`.

* Changes to Supported Compilers- Finally, in order to utilize more
C++11 semantics, we have officially
dropped support for GCC 4.4 and MSVC 2012. Please see our __prerequisites__
page for more details.

[section:hpx_0_9_9 __hpx__ V0.9.9 (Oct 31, 2014, codename Spooky)]

[heading General Changes]

We have had over 1500 commits since the last release and we have closed
over 200 tickets (bugs, feature requests, pull requests, etc.). These are by
far the largest numbers of commits and resolved issues for any of the __hpx__
releases so far.
We are especially happy about the large number of people who contributed for
the first time to __hpx__.

* We completed the transition from the older (non-conforming) implementation
  of `hpx::future` to the new and fully conforming version by removing the
  old code and by renaming the type `hpx::unique_future` to `hpx::future`. In
  order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing code which uses the
  type `hpx::unique_future` we support the configuration variable
  `HPX_UNIQUE_FUTURE_ALIAS`. If this variable is set to `ON` while running
  cmake it will additionally define a template alias for this type.
* We rewrote and significantly changed our build system. Please have a look at
  the new (now generated) documentation here:
  [link hpx.manual.build_system __hpx__ build system]. Please revisit your
  build scripts to adapt to the changes. The most notable changes are:
   * `HPX_NO_INSTALL` is no longer necessary.
   * For external builds, you need to set `HPX_DIR` instead of `HPX_ROOT` as
     described here:
     [link hpx.manual.build_system.using_hpx.using_hpx_cmake Using CMake].
   * IDEs that support multiple configurations (Visual Studio and XCode) can
     now be used as intended. that means no build dir.
   * Building HPX statically (without dynamic libraries) is now supported
     (`-DHPX_STATIC_LINKING=On`).
   * Please note that many variables used to configure the build process have
     been renamed to unify the naming conventions (see the section
     [link hpx.manual.build_system.building_hpx.cmake_variables CMake Variables used to configure __hpx__]
     for more information).
   * This also fixes a long list of issues, for more information see [issue 1204].
* We started to implement various proposals to the C++ Standardization committee
  related to parallelism and concurrency, most notably __cpp11_n4104__ (Working
  Draft, Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Parallelism),
  __cpp11_n4088__ (Task Region Rev. 3), and __cpp11_n4107__ (Working Draft,
  Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Concurrency).
* We completely remodeled our automatic build system to run builds and unit tests
  on various systems and compilers. This allows us to find most bugs right as
  they were introduced and helps to maintain a high level of quality and
  compatibility. The newest build logs can be found at __stellar_hpx_buildbot__.

[section:hpx_0_9_8 __hpx__ V0.9.8 (Mar 24, 2014)]

We have had over 800 commits since the last release and we have closed
over 65 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

With the changes below, __hpx__ is once again leading the charge of a whole
new era of computation. By intrinsically breaking down and synchronizing the
work to be done, __hpx__ insures that application developers will no longer
have to fret about where a segment of code executes. That allows coders to
focus their time and energy to understanding the data dependencies of their
algorithms and thereby the core obstacles to an efficient code. Here are some
of the advantages of using __hpx__:

* __hpx__ is solidly rooted in a sophisticated theoretical execution model --
  ParalleX
* __hpx__ exposes an API fully conforming to the C++11 and the draft C++14
  standards, extended and applied to distributed computing. Everything
  programmers know about the concurrency primitives of the standard C++ library
  is still valid in the context of __hpx__.
* It provides a competitive, high performance implementation of modern,
  future-proof ideas which gives an smooth migration path from todays
  mainstream techniques
* There is no need for the programmer to worry about lower level
  parallelization paradigms like threads or message passing; no need to
  understand pthreads, MPI, OpenMP, or Windows threads, etc.
* There is no need to think about different types of parallelism such as tasks,
  pipelines, or fork-join, task or data parallelism.
* The same source of your program compiles and runs on Linux, BlueGene/Q,
  Mac OS X, Windows, and Android.
* The same code runs on shared memory multi-core systems and supercomputers,
  on handheld devices and Intel[regmark] Xeon Phi[trademark] accelerators, or
  a heterogeneous mix of those.

[heading General Changes]

* A major API breaking change for this release was introduced by implementing
  `hpx::future` and `hpx::shared_future` fully in conformance with the
  __cpp11__. While `hpx::shared_future` is new and will not create any
  compatibility problems, we revised the interface and implementation of the
  existing `hpx::future`. For more details please see the
  [@http://mail.cct.lsu.edu/pipermail/hpx-users/2014-January/000141.html mailing list archive].
  To avoid any incompatibilities for existing code we named the type which
  implements the `std::future` interface as `hpx::unique_future`. For the next
  release this will be renamed to `hpx::future`, making it full conforming to
  __cpp11__.
* A large part of the code base of __hpx__ has been refactored and partially
  re-implemented. The main changes were related to
  * The threading subsystem: these changes significantly reduce the amount of
    overheads caused by the schedulers, improve the modularity of the code
    base, and extend the variety of available scheduling algorithms.
  * The parcel subsystem: these changes improve the performance of the __hpx__
    networking layer, modularize the structure of the parcelports, and
    simplify the creation of new parcelports for other underlying networking
    libraries.
  * The API subsystem: these changes improved the conformance of the API to
    __cpp11__, extend and unify the available API functionality, and decrease
    the overheads created by various elements of the API.
  * The robustness of the component loading subsystem has been improved
    significantly, allowing to more portably and more reliably register the
    components needed by an application as startup. This additionally speeds up
    general application initialization.
* We added new API functionality like `hpx::migrate` and `hpx::copy_component`
  which are the basic building blocks necessary for implementing higher level
  abstractions for system-wide load balancing, runtime-adaptive resource
  management, and object-oriented checkpointing and state-management.
* We removed the use of C++11 move emulation (using Boost.Move), replacing it
  with C++11 rvalue references. This is the first step towards using more and
  more native C++11 facilities which we plan to introduce in the future.
* We improved the reference counting scheme used by __hpx__ which helps
  managing distributed objects and memory. This improves the overall stability
  of __hpx__ and further simplifies writing real world applications.
* The minimal Boost version required to use __hpx__ is now V1.49.0.
* This release coincides with the first release of __hpxpi__ (V0.1.0), the
  first implementation of the __xpi_spec__.

[section:hpx_0_9_6 __hpx__ V0.9.6 (Jul 30, 2013)]

We have had over 1200 commits since the last release and we have closed
roughly 140 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

The major new fetures in this release are:

* We further consolidated the API exposed by __hpx__. We aligned our APIs as much as
  possible with the existing __cpp11__ and related proposals to the
  C++ standardization committee (such as __cpp11_n3632__ and __cpp11_n3634__).
* We implemented a first version of a distributed AGAS service which essentially
  eliminates all explicit AGAS network traffic.
* We created a native ibverbs parcelport allowing to take advantage of the
  superior latency and bandwidth characteristics of Infiniband networks.
* We successfully ported __hpx__ to the Xeon Phi platform.
* Support for the SLURM scheduling system was implemented.
* Major efforts have been dedicated to improving the performance counter
  framework, numerous new counters were implemented and new APIs were added.
* We added a modular parcel compression system allowing to improve bandwidth
  utilization (by reducing the overall size of the tranferred data).
* We added a modular parcel coalescing system allowing to combine several
  parcels into larger messages. This reduces latencies introduced by the
  communication layer.
* Added an experimental executors API allowing to use different scheduling
  policies for different parts of the code. This API has been modelled after
  the Standards proposal __cpp11_n3562__. This API is bound to change in
  the future, though.
* Added minimal security support for localities which is enforced on the
  parcelport level. This support is preliminary and experimental and might
  change in the future.
* We created a parcelport using low level MPI functions. This is in support
  of legacy applications which are to be gradually ported and to support
  platforms where MPI is the only available portable networking layer.
* We added a preliminary and experimental implementation of a tuple-space
  object which exposes an interface similar to such systems described in the
  literature (see for instance __linda__).

[/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////]
[section:hpx_0_9_5 __hpx__ V0.9.5 (Jan 16, 2013)]

We have had over 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed
roughly 150 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

This release is continuing along the lines of code and API consolidation, and
overall usability inprovements. We dedicated much attention to performance and
we were able to significantly improve the threading and networking subsystems.

We successfully ported __hpx__ to the Android platform. __hpx__ applications now not
only can run on mobile devices, but we support heterogeneous applications running
across architecture boundaries. At the Supercomputing Conference 2012 we
demonstrated connecting Android tablets to simulations running on a Linux cluster.
The Android tablet was used to query performance counters from the Linux simulation
and to steer its parameters.

We successfully ported __hpx__ to Mac OSX (using the Clang compiler). Thanks to
Pyry Jahkola for contributing the corresponding patches. Please see the section
__macos_installation__ for more details.

We made a special effort to make HPX usable in highly concurrent use cases. Many
of the HPX API functions which possibly take longer than 100 microseconds to
execute now can be invoked asynchronously. We added uniform support for composing
futures which simplifies to write asynchronous code. HPX actions (function objects
encapsulating possibly concurrent remote function invocations) are now well
integrated with all other API facilities such like `hpx::bind`.

All of the API has been aligned as much as possible with established paradigms.
HPX now mirrors many of the facilities as defined in the __cpp11__, such
as `hpx::thread`, `hpx::function`, `hpx::future`, etc.

A lot of work has been put into improving the documentation. Many of the API
functions are documented now, concepts are explained in detail, and examples
are better described than before. The new documentation index
enables finding information with lesser effort.

This is the first release of HPX we perform after the move to __stellar_hpx_github__.
This step has enabled a wider participation from the community and further encourages
us in our decision to release HPX as a true open source library (HPX is licensed
under the very liberal __boost_license__).

[section:hpx_0_9_0 __hpx__ V0.9.0 (Jul 5, 2012)]

We have had roughly 800 commits since the last release and we have closed
approximately 80 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

* Significant improvements made to the usability of __hpx__ in large-scale,
  distributed environments.
* Renamed [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_task]`<>` to [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_action]`<>` to
  reflect the semantic differences to a packaged_task as defined by the
  __cpp11__.
* __hpx__ now exposes [classref hpx::thread] which is compliant to the C++11 std::thread
  type except that it (purely locally) represents an __hpx__ thread. This new type
  does not expose any of the remote capabilities of the underlying __hpx__-thread
  implementation.
* The type [classref hpx::lcos::future]`<>` is now compliant to the C++11 std::future<>
  type. This type can be used to synchronize both, local and remote operations.
  In both cases the control flow will 'return' to the future in order to
  trigger any continuation.
* The types [classref hpx::lcos::local::promise]`<>` and [classref hpx::lcos::local::packaged_task]`<>`
  are now compliant to the C++11 `std::promise<>`  and `std::packaged_task<>` types.
  These can be used to create a future representing local work only. Use the
  types [classref hpx::lcos::promise]`<>` and [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_action]`<>` to wrap any
  (possibly remote) action into a future.
* [classref hpx::thread] and [classref hpx::lcos::future]`<>` are now cancelable.
* Added support for sequential and logic composition of [classref hpx::lcos::future]`<>`'s.
  The member function [memberref hpx::lcos::future::when]`()` permits futures to
  be sequentially composed. The helper functions [funcref hpx::wait_all], [funcref hpx::wait_any],
  and [funcref hpx::wait_n] can be used to wait for more than one future at a time.
* __hpx__ now exposes [funcref hpx::apply]`()` and [funcref hpx::async]`()` as the preferred way of
  creating (or invoking) any deferred work. These functions are usable with
  various types of functions, function objects, and actions and provide a
  uniform way to spawn deferred tasks.
* __hpx__ now utilizes [funcref hpx::util::bind] to (partially) bind
  local functions and function objects, and also actions. Remote bound actions
  can have placeholders as well.
* __hpx__ continuations are now fully polymorphic. The class
  [classref hpx::actions::forwarding_continuation] is an example of how the user can
  write is own types of continuations. It can be used to execute any function
  as an continuation of a particular action.
* Reworked the action invocation API to be fully conformant to normal functions.
  Actions can now be invoked using [funcref hpx::apply]`()`, [funcref hpx::async]`()`, or using the
  `operator()` implemented on actions. Actions themselves can now be cheaply
  instantiated as they do not have any members anymore.
* Reworked the lazy action invocation API. Actions can now be directly bound
  using [funcref hpx::util::bind]`()` by passing an action instance as the first argument.
* A minimal __hpx__ program now looks like this:
``
      #include <hpx/hpx_init.hpp>

      int hpx_main()
      {
          return hpx::finalize();
      }

      int main()
      {
          return hpx::init();
      }
``
  This removes the immediate dependency on the __boost_program_options__ library.

[note This minimal version of an __hpx__ program does not support any of the
      default command line arguments (such as --help, or command line options
      related to PBS). It is suggested to always pass `argc` and `argv` to
      __hpx__ as shown in the example below.]

* In order to support those, but still not to depend on __boost_program_options__,
  the minimal program can be written as:
``
      #include <hpx/hpx_init.hpp>

      // The arguments for hpx_main can be left off, which very similar to the
      // behavior of `main()` as defined by C++.
      int hpx_main(int argc, char* argv[])
      {
          return hpx::finalize();
      }

      int main(int argc, char* argv[])
      {
          return hpx::init(argc, argv);
      }
``
* Added performance counters exposing the number of component instances which
  are alive on a given locality.
* Added performance counters exposing then number of messages sent and received,
  the number of parcels sent and received, the number of bytes sent and
  received, the overall time required to send and receive data, and the overall
  time required to serialize and deserialize the data.
* Added a new component: [classref hpx::components::binpacking_factory] which is equivalent to the existing
  [classref hpx::components::distributing_factory] component, except that it equalizes the overall
  population of the components to create. It exposes two factory methods, one
  based on the number of existing instances of the component type to create,
  and one based on an arbitrary performance counter which will be queried for
  all relevant localities.
* Added API functions allowing to access elements of the diagnostic information
  embedded in the given exception: [funcref hpx::get_locality_id]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_host_name]`()`,
  [funcref hpx::get_process_id]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_function_name]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_file_name]`()`,
  [funcref hpx::get_line_number]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_os_thread]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_thread_id]`()`, and
  [funcref hpx::get_thread_description]`()`.

[section:hpx_0_8_0 __hpx__ V0.8.0 (Mar 23, 2012)]

We have had roughly 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed
approximately 70 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

* Improved PBS support, allowing for arbitrary naming schemes of node-hostnames.
* Finished verification of the reference counting framework.
* Implemented decrement merging logic to optimize the distributed reference
  counting system.
* Restructured the LCO framework. Renamed [^hpx::lcos::eager_future<>] and
  [^hpx::lcos::lazy_future<>] into [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_task]`<>` and
  [classref hpx::lcos::deferred_packaged_task]`<>`. Split
  [classref hpx::lcos::promise]`<>` into [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_task]`<>`
  and [classref hpx::lcos::future]`<>`. Added 'local' futures
  (in namespace [^hpx::lcos::local]).
* Improved the general performance of local and remote action invocations.
  This (under certain circumstances) drastically reduces the number of copies
  created for each of the parameters and return values.
* Reworked the performance counter framework. Performance counters are now
  created only when needed, which reduces the overall resource requirements.
  The new framework allows for much more flexible creation and management
  of performance counters. The new sine example application demonstrates some
  of the capabilities of the new infrastructure.
* Added a buildbot-based continuous build system which gives instant, automated
  feedback on each commit to SVN.
* Added more automated tests to verify proper functioning of __hpx__.
* Started to create documentation for __hpx__ and its API.
* Added documentation toolchain to the build system.
* Added dataflow LCO.
* Changed default __hpx__ command line options to have [^hpx:] prefix. For
  instance, the former option [^--threads] is now [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:threads]].
  This has been done to make ambiguities with possible application specific
  command line options as unlikely as possible. See the section __commandline__
  for a full list of available options.
* Added the possibility to define command line aliases. The former short
  (one-letter) command line options have been predefined as aliases for
  backwards compatibility. See the section __commandline__ for a detailed
  description of command line option aliasing.
* Network connections are now cached based on the connected host. The number of
  simultaneous connections to a particular host is now limited. Parcels are
  buffered and bundled if all connections are in use.
* Added more refined thread affinity control. This is based on the external
  library __hwloc__.
* Improved support for Windows builds with CMake.
* Added support for components to register their own command line options.
* Added the possibility to register custom startup/shutdown functions for
  any component. These functions are guaranteed to be executed by an __hpx__
  thread.
* Added two new experimental thread schedulers: hierarchy_scheduler and
  periodic_priority_scheduler. These can be activated by using the command line
  options [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:queueing=hierarchy]] or
  [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:queueing=periodic]].

[heading Example Applications]

* [@http://www.graph500.org/ Graph500 performance benchmark] (thanks to Matthew
  Anderson for contributing this application).
* [@http://www.nersc.gov/research-and-development/benchmarking-and-workload-characterization/nersc-6-benchmarks/gtc/ GTC (Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code)]:
  a skeleton for particle in cell type codes.
* Random Memory Access: an example demonstrating random memory accesses in a
  large array
* [@http://stellarcollapse.org/equationofstate ShenEOS example], demonstrating
  partitioning of large read-only data structures and exposing an interpolation
  API.
* Sine performance counter demo.
* Accumulator examples demonstrating how to write and use __hpx__ components.
* Quickstart examples (like hello_world, fibonacci, quicksort, factorial, etc.)
  demonstrating simple __hpx__ concepts which introduce some of the concepts in
  __hpx__.
* Load balancing and work stealing demos.

[heading API Changes]

* Moved all local LCOs into a separate namespace `hpx::lcos::local` (for
  instance, `hpx::lcos::local_mutex` is now [classref hpx::lcos::local::mutex]).
* Replaced `hpx::actions::function` with [classref hpx::util::function]. Cleaned
  up related code.
* Removed `hpx::traits::handle_gid` and moved handling of global reference
  counts into the corresponding serialization code.
* Changed terminology: `prefix` is now called `locality_id`, renamed the
  corresponding API functions (such as `hpx::get_prefix`, which is now called
  `hpx::get_locality_id`).
* Adding [funcref hpx::find_remote_localities]`()`,
  and [funcref hpx::get_num_localities]`()`.
* Changed performance counter naming scheme to make it more bash friendly.
  The new performance counter naming scheme is now

[teletype]
``
    /object{parentname#parentindex/instance#index}/counter#parameters
``
[c++]

* Added `hpx::get_worker_thread_num` replacing `hpx::threadmanager_base::get_thread_num`.
* Renamed `hpx::get_num_os_threads` to `hpx::get_os_threads_count`.
* Added `hpx::threads::get_thread_count`.
* Restructured the Futures sub-system, renaming types in accordance with the
  terminology used by the C++11 ISO standard.

[section:hpx_0_7_0 __hpx__ V0.7.0 (Dec 12, 2011)]

We have had roughly 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed
approximately 120 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

* Completely removed code related to deprecated AGAS V1, started to work on
  AGAS V2.1.
* Started to clean up and streamline the exposed APIs (see 'API changes' below
  for more details).
* Revamped and unified performance counter framework, added a lot of new
  performance counter instances for monitoring of a diverse set of internal
  __hpx__ parameters (queue lengths, access statistics, etc.).
* Improved general error handling and logging support.
* Fixed several race conditions, improved overall stability, decreased memory
  footprint, improved overall performance (major optimizations include native
  TLS support and ranged-based AGAS caching).
* Added support for running __hpx__ applications with PBS.
* Many updates to the build system, added support for gcc 4.5.x and 4.6.x,
  added C++11 support.
* Many updates to default command line options.
* Added many tests, set up buildbot for continuous integration testing.
* Better shutdown handling of distributed applications.

[heading Example Applications]

* quickstart/factorial and quickstart/fibonacci, future-recursive parallel
  algorithms.
* quickstart/hello_world, distributed hello world example.
* quickstart/rma, simple remote memory access example
* quickstart/quicksort, parallel quicksort implementation.
* gtc, gyrokinetic torodial code.
* bfs, breadth-first-search, example code for a graph application.
* sheneos, partitioning of large data sets.
* accumulator, simple component example.
* balancing/os_thread_num, balancing/px_thread_phase, examples demonstrating
  load balancing and work stealing.

[heading API Changes]

  `hpx::lcos::mutex` to `hpx::lcos::local_mutex`
* Removed support for Boost versions older than V1.38, recommended Boost version
  is now V1.47 and newer.
* Removed `hpx::process` (this will be replaced by a real process implementation
  in the future).
* Removed non-functional LCO code (`hpx::lcos::dataflow`, `hpx::lcos::thunk`,
  `hpx::lcos::dataflow_variable`).
