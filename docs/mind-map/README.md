# A mind-map of HPX

This web of mind-maps started as a way to figure out the connections between different parts of the HPX source-code during my internship at CSCS in March-June 2017. The ways we choose visualize concepts and information is quite personal, and so is my map. However after a few weeks I realized that people new to HPX (like I am) might benefit from this way of viewing the code and the connections between its parts, especially since the HPX documentation leaves quite a few questions unanswered.

I wish you good luck and lots of fun with your HPX endeavors and hope you will find these maps helpful. Start by opening the map **jpeg/README.jpg** to get a glimpse of the color code and see a table of content.

If you want to fully enjoy the features of the map (like hyperlinks internal and external to the map, collapsing and unrolling branches) as well as edit it, please open the .xmind file with [XMind](http://www.xmind.net/), an open-source except for pro features, mind-mapping software.
Otherwise, you are welcome to navigate the map in jpeg format (svg and html to come).

This map is by no means complete, and the HPX code is constantly evolving and expanding: contributions and comments are more than welcome, please start an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/shoshijak/hpx/tree/mind-map).

Happy coding and happy mapping!
