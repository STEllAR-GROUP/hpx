[section:whats_new What's New]

[section:hpx_0_9_11 __hpx__ V0.9.11]

[heading General Changes]

* Added integration with the [@https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx CircleCI]
  hosted continuous integration service. This gives us constant and immediate
  feedback on the health of our master branch.
* The compiler configuration subsystem has been reimplemented. Instead of using
  Boost.Config we now use our own lightweight set of cmake scripts to determine
  the available language and library features supported by the used compiler.
* The API for creating instances of components has been consolidated. All
  component instances should be created using the [funcref hpx::new_ `hpx::new_<>()`]
  only. It allows to instantiate both, single component instances and multiple
  component instances. The placement of the created components can be controlled
  by special distribution policies. Please see the corresponding documentation
  outlining the use of [funcref hpx::new_ `hpx::new_<>()`].
* Introduced four new distribution policies which can be used with many API
  functions which traditionally expected to be used with a locality id. The
  new distribution policies are:
  * [classref hpx::components::default_distribution_policy `hpx::default_distribution_policy`]
    which tries to place multiple component instances as evenly as possible.
  * [classref hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy `hpx::colocating_distribution_policy`]
    which will refer to the locality where a given component instance is
    currently placed.
  * [classref hpx::components::binpacking_distribution_policy `hpx::binpacking_distribution_policy`]
    which will place multiple component instances as evenly as possible based
    on any performance counter.
  * [classref hpx::components::target_distribution_policy `hpx::target_distribution_policy`]
    which allows to represent a given locality in the context of a distribution
    policy.
* The new distribution policies can now be also used with `hpx::async`. This
  change also deprecates `hpx::async_colocated(id, ...)` which now is replaced
  by a distribution policy: `hpx::async(hpx::colocated(id), ...).
* The `hpx::vector` and `hpx::unordered_map` data structures can now be used
  with the new distribution policies as well.
* The parallel facility `hpx::parallel::task_region` has been renamed to
  [classref hpx::parallel::v2::task_block `hpx::parallel::task_block`] based on
  the changes in the corresponding standardization proposal __cpp11_n4088__.
* Added extensions to the parallel facility
  [classref hpx::parallel::v2::task_block `hpx::parallel::task_block`] allowing
  to combine a task+_block with an execution policy. This implies a minor
  breaking change as the `hpx::parallel::task_block` is now a template.
* Added new LCOs: `hpx::lcos::latch` and `hpx::lcos::local::latch` which
  semantically conform to the proposed `std::latch` (see __cpp17_n4399__).

[heading Breaking Changes]

* The macro `HPX_REGISTER_MINIMAL_COMPONENT_FACTORY` has been deprecated. Please
  use [macroref HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT `HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT`] instead.
  The old macro will be removed in the next release.
* The obsolete distributing_factory and binpacking_factory components have been
  removed. The corresponding functionality is now provided by the
  [funcref hpx::new_ `hpx::new_<>()`] API function in conjunction with the
  `hpx::default_layout` and `hpx::binpacking` distribution policies
  ([classref hpx::components::default_distribution_policy `hpx::default_distribution_policy`] and
  [classref hpx::components::binpacking_distribution_policy `hpx::binpacking_distribution_policy`])
* The API function `hpx::new_colocated` has been deprecated. Please use the
  consolidated API [funcref hpx::new_ `hpx::new_`] in conjunction with the new
  `hpx::colocated` distribution policy
  ([classref hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy `hpx::colocating_distribution_policy`])
  instead. The old API function will still be available for at least one
  release of __hpx__ if the configuration variable
  `HPX_WITH_COLOCATED_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY` is enabled.
* The API function `hpx::async_colocated` has been deprecated. Please use the
  consolidated API `hpx::async` in conjunction with the new `hpx::colocated`
  distribution policy
  ([classref hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy `hpx::colocating_distribution_policy`])
  instead. The old API function will still be available for
  at least one  release of __hpx__ if the configuration variable
  `HPX_WITH_COLOCATED_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY` is enabled.
* The obsolete remote_object component has been removed.
* Replaced the use of Boost.Serialization with our own solution. While the new
  version is mostly compatible with Boost.Serialization, this change requires
  some minor code modifications in user code. For more information, please see the
  corresponding [@https://mail.cct.lsu.edu/pipermail//hpx-users/2015-April/000558.html announcement]
  on the __stellar_list__ mailing list.
* The names used by cmake to influence various configuration options have been
  unified. The new naming scheme relies on all configuration constants to start
  with `HPX_WITH_...`, while the preprocessor constant which is used at build
  time starts with `HPX_HAVE_...`. For instance, the former cmake command line
  `-DHPX_MALLOC=...` now has to be specified a `-DHPX_WITH_MALLOC=...` and will
  cause the preprocessor constant `HPX_HAVE_MALLOC` to be defined. The actual
  name of the constant (i.e. `MALLOC`) has not changed. Please see the
  corresponding documentation for more details (__cmake_options__).
* The `get_gid()` functions exposed by the component base classes
  `hpx::components::server::simple_component_base`,
  `hpx::components::server::managed_component_base`, and
  `hpx::components::server::fixed_component_base` have been replaced by two new
  functions: `get_unmanaged_id()` and `get_id()`. To enable the old function
  name for backwards compatibility, use the cmake configuration option
  `HPX_WITH_COMPONENT_GET_GID_COMPATIBILITY=On`.
* All functions which were named `get_gid()` but were returning `hpx::id_type`
  have been renamed to `get_id()`. To enable the old function names for
  backwards compatibility, use the cmake configuration option
  `HPX_WITH_COMPONENT_GET_GID_COMPATIBILITY=On`.
