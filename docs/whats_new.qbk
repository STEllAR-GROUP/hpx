[section:hpx_0_9_5 __hpx__ V0.9.5]

We have had roughly 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed
over 140 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

This release is continuing along the lines of code and API consolidation, and
overall usability inprovements. We dedicated much attention to performance and
we were able to significantly improve the threading and networking subsystems.

We successfully ported HPX to the Android platform. HPX applications now not
only can run on mobile devices, but we support heterogeneous applications running
across architecture boundaries. At the Supercomputing Conference 2012 we
demonstrated connecting Android tablets to simulations running on a Linux cluster.
The Android tablet was used to query performance counters from the Linux simulation
and to steer its parameters.

We made a special effort to make HPX usable in highly concurrent use cases. Many
of the HPX API functions which possibly take longer than 100 microseconds to
execute now can be invoked asynchronously. We added uniform support for composing
futures which simplifies to write asynchronous code. HPX actions (function objects
encapsulating possibly concurrent remote function invocations) are now well
integrated with all other API facilities such like `hpx::bind`.

All of the API has been aligned as much as possible with established paradigms.
HPX now mirrors many of the facilities as defined in the C++11 Standard, such
as `hpx::thread`, `hpx::function`, `hpx::future`, etc.

This is the first release of HPX we perform after the move to __stellar_hpx_github__.
This step has enabled a wider participation from the community and further encourages
us in our decision to release HPX as a true open source library (HPX is licensed
under the very liberal __boost_license__).

[/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////]
[section:hpx_0_9_0 __hpx__ V0.9.0]

We have had roughly 800 commits since the last release and we have closed
approximately 80 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

* Significant improvements made to the usability of __hpx__ in large-scale,
  distributed environments.
* Renamed [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_task]`<>` to [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_action]`<>` to
  reflect the semantic differences to a packaged_task as defined by the C++11
  standard.
* __hpx__ now exposes [classref hpx::thread] which is compliant to the C++11 std::thread
  type except that it (purely locally) represents an __hpx__ thread. This new type
  does not expose any of the remote capabilities of the underlying __hpx__-thread
  implementation.
* The type [classref hpx::lcos::future]`<>` is now compliant to the C++11 std::future<>
  type. This type can be used to synchronize both, local and remote operations.
  In both cases the control flow will 'return' to the future in order to
  trigger any continuation.
* The types [classref hpx::lcos::local::promise]`<>` and [classref hpx::lcos::local::packaged_task]`<>`
  are now compliant to the C++11 `std::promise<>`  and `std::packaged_task<>` types.
  These can be used to create a future representing local work only. Use the
  types [classref hpx::lcos::promise]`<>` and [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_action]`<>` to wrap any
  (possibly remote) action into a future.
* [classref hpx::thread] and [classref hpx::lcos::future]`<>` are now cancelable.
* Added support for sequential and logic composition of [classref hpx::lcos::future]`<>`'s.
  The member function [memberref hpx::lcos::future::when]`()` allows to sequentially
  compose futures, while the helper functions [funcref hpx::wait_all], [funcref hpx::wait_any],
  and [funcref hpx::wait_n] can be used to wait for more than one future at a time.
* __hpx__ now exposes [funcref hpx::apply]`()` and [funcref hpx::async]`()` as the preferred way of
  creating (or invoking) any deferred work. These functions are usable with
  various types of functions, function objects, and actions and provide a
  uniform way to spawn deferred tasks.
* __hpx__ now allows to utilize [funcref hpx::util::bind] to (partially) bind no only
  local functions and function objects, but also actions. Remote bound actions
  can have placeholders as well.
* __hpx__ continuations are now fully polymorphic. The class
  [classref hpx::actions::forwarding_continuation] is an example of how the user can
  write is own types of continuations. It can be used to execute any function
  as an continuation of a particular action.
* Reworked the action invocation API to be fully conformant to normal functions.
  Actions can now be invoked using [funcref hpx::apply]`()`, [funcref hpx::async]`()`, or using the
  `operator()` implemented on actions. Actions themselves can now be cheaply
  instantiated as they do not have any members anymore.
* Reworked the lazy action invocation API. Actions can now be directly bound
  using [funcref hpx::util::bind]`()` by passing an action instance as the first argument.
* A minimal __hpx__ program now looks like this:
``
      #include <hpx/hpx_init.hpp>

      int hpx_main()
      {
          return hpx::finalize();
      }

      int main()
      {
          return hpx::init();
      }
``
  This removes the immediate dependency on the __boost_program_options__ library.

[note This minimal version of an __hpx__ program does not support any of the
      default command line arguments (such as --help, or command line options
      related to PBS). It is suggested to always pass `argc` and `argv` to
      __hpx__ as shown in the example below.]

* In order to support those, but still not to depend on __boost_program_options__,
  the minimal program can be written as:
``
      #include <hpx/hpx_init.hpp>

      // The arguments for hpx_main can be left off, which very similar to the
      // behavior of `main()` as defined by C++.
      int hpx_main(int argc, char* argv[])
      {
          return hpx::finalize();
      }

      int main(int argc, char* argv[])
      {
          return hpx::init(argc, argv);
      }
``
* Added performance counters exposing the number of component instances which
  are alive on a given locality.
* Added performance counters exposing then number of messages sent and received,
  the number of parcels sent and received, the number of bytes sent and
  received, the overall time required to send and receive data, and the overall
  time required to serialize and deserialize the data.
* Added a new component: [classref hpx::components::binpacking_factory] which is equivalent to the existing
  [classref hpx::components::distributing_factory] component, except that it equalizes the overall
  population of the components to create. It exposes two factory methods, one
  based on the number of existing instances of the component type to create,
  and one based on an arbitrary performance counter which will be queried for
  all relevant localities.
* Added API functions allowing to access elements of the diagnostic information
  embedded in the given exception: [funcref hpx::get_locality_id]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_host_name]`()`,
  [funcref hpx::get_process_id]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_function_name]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_file_name]`()`,
  [funcref hpx::get_line_number]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_os_thread]`()`, [funcref hpx::get_thread_id]`()`, and
  [funcref hpx::get_thread_description]`()`.

[/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////]
[section:hpx_0_8_0 __hpx__ V0.8.0]

We have had roughly 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed
approximately 70 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

* Improved PBS support, allowing for arbitrary naming schemes of node-hostnames.
* Finished verification of the reference counting framework.
* Implemented decrement merging logic to optimize the distributed reference
  counting system.
* Restructured the LCO framework. Renamed [^hpx::lcos::eager_future<>] and
  [^hpx::lcos::lazy_future<>] into [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_task]`<>` and
  [classref hpx::lcos::deferred_packaged_task]`<>`. Split
  [classref hpx::lcos::promise]`<>` into [classref hpx::lcos::packaged_task]`<>`
  and [classref hpx::lcos::future]`<>`. Added 'local' futures
  (in namespace [^hpx::lcos::local]).
* Improved the general performance of local and remote action invocations.
  This (under certain circumstances) drastically reduces the number of copies
  created for each of the parameters and return values.
* Reworked the performance counter framework. Performance counters are now
  created only when needed, which reduces the overall resource requirements.
  The new framework allows for much more flexible creation and management
  of performance counters. The new sine example application demonstrates some
  of the capabilities of the new infrastructure.
* Added a buildbot-based continuous build system which gives instant, automated
  feedback on each commit to SVN.
* Added more automated tests to verify proper functioning of __hpx__.
* Started to create documentation for __hpx__ and its API.
* Added documentation toolchain to the build system.
* Added dataflow LCO.
* Changed default __hpx__ command line options to have [^hpx:] prefix. For
  instance, the former option [^--threads] is now [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:threads]].
  This has been done to make ambiguities with possible application specific
  command line options as unlikely as possible. See the section __commandline__
  for a full list of available options.
* Added the possibility to define command line aliases. The former short
  (one-letter) command line options have been predefined as aliases for
  backwards compatibility. See the section __commandline__ for a detailed
  description of command line option aliasing.
* Network connections are now cached based on the connected host. The number of
  simultaneous connections to a particular host is now limited. Parcels are
  buffered and bundled if all connections are in use.
* Added more refined thread affinity control. This is based on the external
  library __hwloc__.
* Improved support for Windows builds with CMake.
* Added support for components to register their own command line options.
* Added the possibility to register custom startup/shutdown functions for
  any component. These functions are guaranteed to be executed by an __hpx__
  thread.
* Added two new experimental thread schedulers: hierarchy_scheduler and
  periodic_priority_scheduler. These can be activated by using the command line
  options [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:queueing=hierarchy]] or
  [hpx_cmdline [^--hpx:queueing=periodic]].

[heading Example Applications]

* [@http://www.graph500.org/ Graph500 performance benchmark] (thanks to Matthew
  Anderson for contributing this application).
* [@http://www.nersc.gov/research-and-development/benchmarking-and-workload-characterization/nersc-6-benchmarks/gtc/ GTC (Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code)]:
  a skeleton for particle in cell type codes.
* Random Memory Access: an example demonstrating random memory accesses in a
  large array
* [@http://stellarcollapse.org/equationofstate ShenEOS example], demonstrating
  partitioning of large read-only data structures and exposing an interpolation
  API.
* Sine performance counter demo.
* Accumulator examples demonstrating how to write and use __hpx__ components.
* Quickstart examples (like hello_world, fibonacci, quicksort, factorial, etc.)
  demonstrating simple __hpx__ concepts which introduce some of the concepts in
  __hpx__.
* Load balancing and work stealing demos.

[heading API Changes]

* Moved all local LCOs into a separate namespace `hpx::lcos::local` (for
  instance, `hpx::lcos::local_mutex` is now [classref hpx::lcos::local::mutex]).
* Replaced `hpx::actions::function` with [classref hpx::util::function]. Cleaned
  up related code.
* Removed `hpx::traits::handle_gid` and moved handling of global reference
  counts into the corresponding serialization code.
* Changed terminology: `prefix` is now called `locality_id`, renamed the
  corresponding API functions (such as `hpx::get_prefix`, which is now called
  `hpx::get_locality_id`).
* Adding [funcref hpx::find_remote_localities]`()`,
  and [funcref hpx::get_num_localities]`()`.
* Changed performance counter naming scheme to make it more bash friendly.
  The new performance counter naming scheme is now

[teletype]
``
    /object{parentname#parentindex/instance#index}/counter#parameters
``
[c++]

* Added `hpx::get_worker_thread_num` replacing `hpx::threadmanager_base::get_thread_num`.

[/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////]
[section:hpx_0_7_0 __hpx__ V0.7.0]

We have had roughly 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed
approximately 120 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

[heading General Changes]

* Completely removed code related to deprecated AGAS V1, started to work on
  AGAS V2.1.
* Started to clean up and streamline the exposed APIs (see 'API changes' below
  for more details).
* Revamped and unified performance counter framework, added a lot of new
  performance counter instances for monitoring of a diverse set of internal
  __hpx__ parameters (queue lengths, access statistics, etc.).
* Improved general error handling and logging support.
* Fixed several race conditions, improved overall stability, decreased memory
  footprint, improved overall performance (major optimizations include native
  TLS support and ranged-based AGAS caching).
* Added support for running __hpx__ applications with PBS.
* Many updates to the build system, added support for gcc 4.5.x and 4.6.x,
  added C++11 support.
* Many updates to default command line options.
* Added many tests, set up buildbot for continuous integration testing.
* Better shutdown handling of distributed applications.

[heading Example Applications]

* quickstart/factorial and quickstart/fibonacci, future-recursive parallel
  algorithms.
* quickstart/hello_world, distributed hello world example.
* quickstart/rma, simple remote memory access example
* quickstart/quicksort, parallel quicksort implementation.
* gtc, gyrokinetic torodial code.
* bfs, breadth-first-search, example code for a graph application.
* sheneos, partitioning of large data sets.
* accumulator, simple component example.
* balancing/os_thread_num, balancing/px_thread_phase, examples demonstrating
  load balancing and work stealing.

[heading API Changes]

* Added `hpx::find_all_localities`.
* Added `hpx::terminate` for non-graceful termination of applications.
* Added `hpx::lcos::async` functions for simpler asynchronous programming.
* Added new AGAS interface for handling of symbolic namespace (`hpx::agas::*`).
* Renamed `hpx::components::wait` to `hpx::lcos::wait`.
* Renamed `hpx::lcos::future_value` to `hpx::lcos::promise`.
* Renamed `hpx::lcos::recursive_mutex` to `hpx::lcos::local_recursive_mutex`,
  `hpx::lcos::mutex` to `hpx::lcos::local_mutex`
* Removed support for Boost versions older than V1.38, recommended Boost version
  is now V1.47 and newer.
* Removed `hpx::process` (this will be replaced by a real process implementation
  in the future).
* Removed non-functional LCO code (`hpx::lcos::dataflow`, `hpx::lcos::thunk`,
  `hpx::lcos::dataflow_variable`).
* Removed deprecated `hpx::naming::full_address`.
