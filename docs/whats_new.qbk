[section:hpx_1_1_0 __hpx__ V1.1]

[heading General Changes]

Here are some of the main highlights and changes for this release (in no
particular order):

* Added a compatibility layer for `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, and
  `std::condition_variable` allowing for the code to use those facilities where
  available and to fall back to the corresponding Boost facilities otherwise.
  The cmake configuration option `-DHPX_WITH_THREAD_COMPATIBILITY=On` can be
  used to force using the Boost equivalents.
* The parameter sequence for the `hpx::parallel::transform_inclusive_scan` overload
  taking one iterator range has changed (again) to match the changes this algorithm
  has undergone while being moved to C++17. The old overloads can be still enabled
  at configure time by passing `-DHPX_WITH_TRANSFORM_REDUCE_COMPATIBILITY=On`
  to __cmake__.
* The parameter sequence for the `hpx::parallel::inclusive_scan` overload
  taking one iterator range has changed to match the changes this algorithm
  has undergone while being moved to C++17. The old overloads can be still enabled
  at configure time by passing `-DHPX_WITH_INCLUSIVE_SCAN_COMPATIBILITY=On`
  to __cmake__.
* Added a helper facility `hpx::local_new` which is equivalent to `hpx::new_`
  except that it creates components locally only. As a consequence, the used
  component constructor may accept non-serializable argument types and/or
  non-const references or pointers.
* Removed the (broken) component type `hpx::lcos::queue<T>`. The old type is
  still available at configure time by passing
  `-DHPX_WITH_QUEUE_COMPATIBILITY=On` to __cmake__.
* The parallel algorithms adopted for C++17 restrict the iterator categories
  usable with those to at least forward iterators. Our implementation of the
  parallel algorithms was supporting input iterators (and output iterators)
  as well by simply falling back to sequential execution. We have now made
  our implementations conforming by requiring at least forward iterators. In
  order to enable the old behavior use the the compatibility option
  `-DHPX_WITH_ALGORITHM_INPUT_ITERATOR_SUPPORT=On` on the __cmake__ command
  line.

[heading Breaking Changes]

* We have dropped support for the gcc compiler version V4.8. The
  minimal gcc version we now test on is gcc V4.9.
* We have dropped support for the Visual Studio 2013 compiler version. The
  minimal Visual Studio version we now test on is Visual Studio 2015.5.
