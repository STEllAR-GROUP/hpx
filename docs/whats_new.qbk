[section:hpx_0_9_9 __hpx__ V0.9.9]

[heading General Changes]

* We completed the transition from the older (non-conforming) implementation
  of `hpx::future` to the new and fully conforming version by removing the
  old code and by renaming the type `hpx::unique_future` to `hpx::future`. In
  order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing code which uses the
  type `hpx::unique_future` we support the configuration variable
  `HPX_UNIQUE_FUTURE_ALIAS`. If this variable is set to `ON` while running
  cmake it will additionally define a template alias for this type.
