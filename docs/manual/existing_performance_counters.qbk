[section:counters Existing __hpx__ Performance Counters]

The __hpx__ runtime system exposes a wide variety of predefined Performance
Counters. These counters expose critical information about different modules of
the runtime system. They can help determine system bottlenecks and fine-tune
system and application performance.

[note The /arithmetics counters can consume an arbitrary number of other counters.
    For this reason those have to be specified as parameters (a comma separated
    list of counters appended after a `'@'`). For instance:
    ```
        ./bin/hello_world -t2 \
            --hpx:print-counter=/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative \
            --hpx:print-counter=/arithmetics/add@/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative
        hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
        hello world from OS-thread 1 on locality 0
        /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#0}/count/cumulative,1,0.515640,[s],25
        /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#1}/count/cumulative,1,0.515520,[s],36
        /arithmetics/add@/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative,1,0.516445,[s],64
    ```
    Since all wildcards in the parameters are expanded, this example is fully equivalent to
    specifying both counters separately to `/arithmetics/add`:
    ```
        ./bin/hello_world -t2 \
            --hpx:print-counter=/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative \
            --hpx:print-counter=/arithmetics/add@\
                /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#0}/count/cumulative,\
                /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#1}/count/cumulative
