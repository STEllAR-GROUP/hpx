[section:testing Testing __hpx__]

To ensure correcteness of __hpx__, we ship a large variety of unit and regression tests.
The tests are driven by the __ctest__ tool and ran automatically by buildbot on each commit.
In addition, it is encouraged to run the test suite manually to ensure proper operation on
your target system. If a test fails for your platform, we highly recommend to submit an issue
on our bug tracker with detailed information about the target system.

[section:running_tests Running tests manually]

Running the tests manually is as easy as typing ``make tests``. This will build all tests and
run them once the tests are build successfully. After the tests have been built, you can
invoke seperate tests with the help of the ``ctest`` command. Please see the __ctest_doc__ for
further details.
