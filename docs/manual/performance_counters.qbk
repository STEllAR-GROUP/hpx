[section:performance_counters Performance Counters]

Performance Counters in __hpx__ are used to provide information as to how well
the runtime system or an application is performing. The counter data can help
determine system bottlenecks and fine-tune system and application performance.
The __hpx__ runtime system, its networking and other layers provide counter
data that an application can consume to provide users with information of how
well the application is performing.

Applications can also use counter data to determine how much system resources
to consume. For example, an application that transfers data over the network
could consume counter data from an  network switch to determine how much data
to transfer without competing for network bandwidth with other network traffic.
The application could use the counter data to adjust its transfer rate as the
bandwidth usage from other network traffic increases or decreases.

Performance Counters are __hpx__ parallel processes which expose a predefined
interface. __hpx__ exposes special API functions allowing to create, manage,
access the data from, and release instances of Performance Counters. The main
means to identify a Performance Counter instance is the counter instance name.
Performance Counter instance names have a predefined structure which is
described in the section __counter_names__. The main advantages of this is that
any Performance Counter can be accessed remotely (from a different locality)
or locally (from the same locality). Moreover, since all counters expose their
data using the same API, any code consuming counter data can be utilized to
access arbitrary system information with minimal effort.

Consumers of counter data can consume counter data in real time. Real time data
describes the current activity of the computer. More information about how
to consume counter data can be found in the section __consuming_counters__.

All __hpx__ applications provide command line options related to performance
counters, such as the possibility to list available counter types, or
periodically query the counter data of specific counters to be printed to the
screen or to be written to a file. For more information about these, please
refer to the section __commandline__.
