The |stellar|_ Group (pronounced as stellar) stands for "\ **S**\ ystems \
**T**\ echnology, \ **E**\ mergent Para\ **ll**\ elism, and \ **A**\ lgorithm \
**R**\ esearch". We are an international group of faculty, researchers, and
students working at various institutions around the world. The goal of the
|stellar|_ Group is to promote the development of scalable parallel applications
by providing a community for ideas, a framework for collaboration, and a
platform for communicating these concepts to the broader community.

Our work is focused on building technologies for scalable parallel applications.
|hpx|, our general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed
applications, is no exception. We use |hpx| for a broad range of scientific
applications, helping scientists and developers to write code which scales
better and shows better performance compared to more conventional programming
models such as MPI.

|hpx| is based on *ParalleX* which is a new (and still experimental) parallel
execution model aiming to overcome the limitations imposed by the current
hardware and the techniques we use to write applications today. Our group
focuses on two types of applications - those requiring excellent strong scaling,
allowing for a dramatic reduction of execution time for fixed workloads and
those needing highest level of sustained performance through massive
parallelism. These applications are presently unable (through conventional
practices) to effectively exploit a relatively small number of cores in a
multi-core system. By extension, these application will not be able to exploit
high-end exascale computing systems which are likely to employ hundreds of
millions of such cores by the end of this decade.

Critical bottlenecks to the effective use of new generation high performance
computing (HPC) systems include:

* *Starvation*: due to lack of usable application parallelism and means of
  managing it,
* *Overhead*: reduction to permit strong scalability, improve efficiency, and
  enable dynamic resource management,
* *Latency*: from remote access across system or to local memories,
* *Contention*: due to multicore chip I/O pins, memory banks, and system
  interconnects.

The ParalleX model has been devised to address these challenges by enabling a
new computing dynamic through the application of message-driven computation in a
global address space context with lightweight synchronization. The work on |hpx|
is centered around implementing the concepts as defined by the ParalleX model.
|hpx| is currently targeted at conventional machines, such as classical Linux
based Beowulf clusters and SMP nodes.

We fully understand that the success of |hpx| (and ParalleX) is very much the
result of the work of many people. To see a list of who is contributing see our
