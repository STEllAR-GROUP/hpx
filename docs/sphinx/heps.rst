===========================
|hpx| Enhancement Proposals
===========================

|hpx| Enhancement Proposals (HEPs) are proposals for major changes to |hpx| that
require wider discussion with the |hpx| developers and users before being
implemented.

.. note::

   As HEPs are a new process for |hpx|, HEPs archived here are currently
   considered as the final decision regarding a topic, but may receive
   modifications even after being accepted if deemed necessary. As the process
   is formalized we may consider HEPs immutable, but they may be modified or
   superceded by newer HEPs.
