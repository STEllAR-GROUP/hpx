===========================
|hpx| V0.9.6 (Jul 30, 2013)
===========================

We have had over 1200 commits since the last release and we have closed
roughly 140 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

General changes
===============

The major new fetures in this release are:

* We further consolidated the API exposed by |hpx|. We aligned our APIs as much
  as possible with the existing |cpp11|_ and related proposals to the C++
  standardization committee (such as |cpp11_n3632|_ and |cpp11_n3634|_).
* We implemented a first version of a distributed AGAS service which essentially
  eliminates all explicit AGAS network traffic.
* We created a native ibverbs parcelport allowing to take advantage of the
  superior latency and bandwidth characteristics of Infiniband networks.
* We successfully ported |hpx| to the Xeon Phi platform.
* Support for the SLURM scheduling system was implemented.
* Major efforts have been dedicated to improving the performance counter
  framework, numerous new counters were implemented and new APIs were added.
* We added a modular parcel compression system allowing to improve bandwidth
  utilization (by reducing the overall size of the tranferred data).
* We added a modular parcel coalescing system allowing to combine several
  parcels into larger messages. This reduces latencies introduced by the
  communication layer.
* Added an experimental executors API allowing to use different scheduling
  policies for different parts of the code. This API has been modelled after the
  Standards proposal |cpp11_n3562|_. This API is bound to change in the future,
  though.
* Added minimal security support for localities which is enforced on the
  parcelport level. This support is preliminary and experimental and might
  change in the future.
* We created a parcelport using low level MPI functions. This is in support of
  legacy applications which are to be gradually ported and to support platforms
  where MPI is the only available portable networking layer.
* We added a preliminary and experimental implementation of a tuple-space object
  which exposes an interface similar to such systems described in the literature
  (see for instance |linda|_).
