===========================
|hpx| V0.9.8 (Mar 24, 2014)
===========================

We have had over 800 commits since the last release and we have closed over 65
tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

With the changes below, |hpx| is once again leading the charge of a whole new
era of computation. By intrinsically breaking down and synchronizing the work to
be done, |hpx| insures that application developers will no longer have to fret
about where a segment of code executes. That allows coders to focus their time
and energy to understanding the data dependencies of their algorithms and
thereby the core obstacles to an efficient code. Here are some of the advantages
of using |hpx|:

* |hpx| is solidly rooted in a sophisticated theoretical execution model --
  ParalleX
* |hpx| exposes an API fully conforming to the C++11 and the draft C++14
  standards, extended and applied to distributed computing. Everything
  programmers know about the concurrency primitives of the standard C++ library
  is still valid in the context of |hpx|.
* It provides a competitive, high performance implementation of modern,
  future-proof ideas which gives an smooth migration path from todays mainstream
  techniques
* There is no need for the programmer to worry about lower level parallelization
  paradigms like threads or message passing; no need to understand pthreads,
  MPI, OpenMP, or Windows threads, etc.
* There is no need to think about different types of parallelism such as tasks,
  pipelines, or fork-join, task or data parallelism.
* The same source of your program compiles and runs on Linux, BlueGene/Q, Mac OS
  X, Windows, and Android.
* The same code runs on shared memory multi-core systems and supercomputers, on
  handheld devices and Intel\ |reg| Xeon Phi\ |trade| accelerators, or a
  heterogeneous mix of those.

General changes
===============

* A major API breaking change for this release was introduced by implementing
  ``hpx::future`` and ``hpx::shared_future`` fully in conformance with the
  |cpp11|_. While ``hpx::shared_future`` is new and will not create any
  compatibility problems, we revised the interface and implementation of the
  existing ``hpx::future``. For more details please see the `mailing list
  archive
  <http://mail.cct.lsu.edu/pipermail/hpx-users/2014-January/000141.html>`_. To
  avoid any incompatibilities for existing code we named the type which
  implements the ``std::future`` interface as ``hpx::unique_future``. For the
  next release this will be renamed to ``hpx::future``, making it full
  conforming to |cpp11|_.
* A large part of the code base of |hpx| has been refactored and partially
  re-implemented. The main changes were related to

  * The threading subsystem: these changes significantly reduce the amount of
    overheads caused by the schedulers, improve the modularity of the code
    base, and extend the variety of available scheduling algorithms.
  * The parcel subsystem: these changes improve the performance of the |hpx|
    networking layer, modularize the structure of the parcelports, and
    simplify the creation of new parcelports for other underlying networking
    libraries.
  * The API subsystem: these changes improved the conformance of the API to
    |cpp11|, extend and unify the available API functionality, and decrease
    the overheads created by various elements of the API.
  * The robustness of the component loading subsystem has been improved
    significantly, allowing to more portably and more reliably register the
    components needed by an application as startup. This additionally speeds up
    general application initialization.
* We added new API functionality like ``hpx::migrate`` and ``hpx::copy_component``
  which are the basic building blocks necessary for implementing higher level
  abstractions for system-wide load balancing, runtime-adaptive resource
  management, and object-oriented checkpointing and state-management.
* We removed the use of C++11 move emulation (using Boost.Move), replacing it
  with C++11 rvalue references. This is the first step towards using more and
  more native C++11 facilities which we plan to introduce in the future.
* We improved the reference counting scheme used by |hpx| which helps
  managing distributed objects and memory. This improves the overall stability
  of |hpx| and further simplifies writing real world applications.
* The minimal Boost version required to use |hpx| is now V1.49.0.
* This release coincides with the first release of |hpxpi| (V0.1.0), the
  first implementation of the |xpi_spec|_.
