===========================
|hpx| V1.2.0 (Nov 12, 2018)
===========================

General changes
===============

Here are some of the main highlights and changes for this release:

* Thanks to the work of our Google Summer of Code student, Nikunj Gupta, we now
  have a new implementation of ``hpx_main.hpp`` on supported platforms (Linux,
  BSD and MacOS). This is intended to be a less fragile drop-in replacement for
  the old implementation relying on preprocessor macros. The new implementation
  does not require changes if you are using the |cmake|_ or pkg-config. The old
  behaviour can be restored by setting ``HPX_WITH_DYNAMIC_HPX_MAIN=OFF`` during
  |cmake|_ configuration. The implementation on Windows is unchanged.
* We have added functionality to allow passing scheduling hints to our
  schedulers. These will allow us to create executors that for example target a
  specific NUMA domain or allow for |hpx| threads to be pinned to a particular
  worker thread.
* We have significantly improved the performance of our futures implementation
  by making the shared state atomic.
* We have replaced Boostbook by Sphinx for our documentation. This means the
  documentation is easier to navigate with built-in search and table of
  contents. We have also added a quick start section and restructured the
  documentation to be easier to follow for new users.
* We have added a new option to the :option:`--hpx:threads` command line option.
  It is now possible to use ``cores`` to tell |hpx| to only use one worker
  thread per core, unlike the existing option ``all`` which uses one worker
  thread per processing unit (processing unit can be a hyperthread if
  hyperthreads are available). The default value of :option:`--hpx:threads` has
  also been changed to ``cores`` as this leads to better performance in most
  cases.
* All command line options can now be passed alongside configuration options
  when initializing |hpx|. This means that some options that were previously
  only available on the command line can now be set as configuration options.
* HPXMP is a portable, scalable, and flexible application programming interface
  using the OpenMP specification that supports multi-platform shared memory
  multiprocessing programming in C and C++. HPXMP can be enabled within |hpx| by
  setting ``DHPX_WITH_HPXMP=ON`` during |cmake|_ configuration.
* Two new performance counters were added for measuring the time spent doing
  background work. ``/threads/time/background-work-duration`` returns the time
  spent doing background on a given thread or locality, while
  ``/threads/time/background-overhead`` returns the fraction of time spent doing
  background work with respect to the overall time spent running the scheduler.
  The new performance counters are disabled by default and can be turned on by
  setting ``HPX_WITH_BACKGROUND_THREAD_COUNTERS=ON`` during |cmake|_
  configuration.
* The idling behaviour of |hpx| has been tweaked to allow for faster idling.
  This is useful in interactive applications where the |hpx| worker threads may
  not have work all the time. This behaviour can be tweaked and turned off as
  before with ``HPX_WITH_THREAD_MANAGER_IDLE_BACKOFF=OFF`` during |cmake|_
  configuration.
* It is now possible to register callback functions for |hpx| worker thread
  events. Callbacks can be registered for starting and stopping worker threads,
  and for when errors occur.

Breaking changes
================

* The implementation of ``hpx_main.hpp`` has changed. If you are using custom
  Makefiles you will need to make changes. Please see the documentation on
  :ref:`using Makefiles <makefile>` for more details.
* The default value of :option:`--hpx:threads` has changed from ``all`` to
  ``cores``. The new option ``cores`` only starts one worker thread per core.
* We have dropped support for Boost 1.56 and 1.57. The minimal version of Boost
  we now test is 1.58.
* Our ``boost::format``\ -based formatting implementation has been revised and
  replaced with a custom implementation. This changes the formatting syntax and
  requires changes if you are relying on :cpp:func:`hpx::util::format` or
  :cpp:func:`hpx::util::format_to`. The pull request for this change contains
  more information: :hpx-pr:`3266`.
* The following deprecated options have now been completely removed:
  ``HPX_WITH_ASYNC_FUNCTION_COMPATIBILITY``, ``HPX_WITH_LOCAL_DATAFLOW``,
  ``HPX_WITH_GENERIC_EXECUTION_POLICY``,
  ``HPX_WITH_BOOST_CHRONO_COMPATIBILITY``, ``HPX_WITH_EXECUTOR_COMPATIBILITY``,
  ``HPX_WITH_EXECUTION_POLICY_COMPATIBILITY``, and
  ``HPX_WITH_TRANSFORM_REDUCE_COMPATIBILITY``.
