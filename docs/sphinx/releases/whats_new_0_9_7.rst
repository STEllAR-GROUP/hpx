===========================
|hpx| V0.9.7 (Nov 13, 2013)
===========================

We have had over 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed over 180
tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

General changes
===============

* Ported HPX to BlueGene/Q
* Improved HPX support for Xeon/Phi accelerators
* Reimplemented ``hpx::bind``, ``hpx::tuple``, and ``hpx::function`` for better
  performance and better compliance with the |cpp11|. Added ``hpx::mem_fn``.
* Reworked ``hpx::when_all`` and ``hpx::when_any`` for better compliance with
  the ongoing C++ standardization effort, added heterogeneous version for those
  functions. Added ``hpx::when_any_swapped``.
* Added ``hpx::copy`` as a precursor for a migrate functionality
* Added ``hpx::get_ptr`` allowing to directly access the memory underlying a
  given component
* Added the ``hpx::lcos::broadcast``, ``hpx::lcos::reduce``, and
  ``hpx::lcos::fold`` collective operations
* Added ``hpx::get_locality_name`` allowing to retrieve the name of any of the
  localities for the application.
* Added support for more flexible thread affinity control from the HPX command
  line, such as new modes for ``--hpx:bind`` (``balanced``, ``scattered``,
  ``compact``), improved default settings when running multiple localities on
  the same node.
* Added experimental executors for simpler thread pooling and scheduling. This
  API may change in the future as it will stay aligned with the ongoing C++
  standardization efforts.
* Massively improved the performance of the HPX serialization code. Added
  partial support for zero copy serialization of array and bitwise-copyable
  types.
* General performance improvements of the code related to threads and futures.
