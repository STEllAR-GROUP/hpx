============================
|hpx| V0.9.11 (Nov 11, 2015)
============================

Our main focus for this release was the design and development of a coherent set
of higher-level APIs exposing various types of parallelism to the application
programmer. We introduced the concepts of an ``executor``, which can be used to
customize the ``where`` and ``when`` of execution of tasks in the context of
parallelizing codes. We extended all APIs related to managing parallel tasks to
support executors which gives the user the choce of either using one of the
predefined executor types or to provide its own, possibly application specific,
executor. We paid very close attention to align all of these changes with the
existing C++ Standards documents or with the ongoing proposals for
standardization.

This release is the first after our change to a new development policy. We
switched all development to be strictly performed on branches only, all direct
commits to our main branch (``master``) are prohibited. Any change has to go
through a peer review before it will be merged to ``master``. As a result the
overall stability of our code base has significantly increased, the development
process itself has been simplified. This change manifests itself in a large
number of pull-requests which have been merged (please see below for a full list
of closed issues and pull-requests). All in all for this release, we closed
almost 100 issues and merged over 290 pull-requests. There have been over 1600
commits to the master branch since the last release.

General changes
===============

* We are moving into the direction of unifying managed and simple components. As
  such, the classes :cpp:class:`hpx::components::component` and
  :cpp:class:`hpx::components::component_base` have been added which currently
  just forward to the currently existing simple component facilities. The
  examples have been converted to only use those two classes.
* Added integration with the `CircleCI
  <https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx>`__ hosted continuous integration
  service. This gives us constant and immediate feedback on the health of our
  master branch.
* The compiler configuration subsystem in the build system has been
  reimplemented. Instead of using Boost.Config we now use our own lightweight
  set of cmake scripts to determine the available language and library features
  supported by the used compiler.
* The API for creating instances of components has been consolidated. All
  component instances should be created using the :cpp:func:`hpx::new_` only. It
  allows one to instantiate both, single component instances and multiple
  component instances. The placement of the created components can be controlled
  by special distribution policies. Please see the corresponding documentation
  outlining the use of :cpp:func:`hpx::new_`.
* Introduced four new distribution policies which can be used with many API
  functions which traditionally expected to be used with a locality id. The new
  distribution policies are:

  * :cpp:class:`hpx::components::default_distribution_policy` which tries to
    place multiple component instances as evenly as possible.
  * :cpp:class:`hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy` which will
    refer to the locality where a given component instance is currently placed.
  * :cpp:class:`hpx::components::binpacking_distribution_policy` which will
    place multiple component instances as evenly as possible based on any
    performance counter.
  * :cpp:class:`hpx::components::target_distribution_policy` which allows one to
    represent a given locality in the context of a distrwibution policy.
* The new distribution policies can now be also used with ``hpx::async``. This
  change also deprecates ``hpx::async_colocated(id, ...)`` which now is replaced
  by a distribution policy: ``hpx::async(hpx::colocated(id), ...)``.
* The ``hpx::vector`` and ``hpx::unordered_map`` data structures can now be used
  with the new distribution policies as well.
* The parallel facility ``hpx::parallel::task_region`` has been renamed to
  :cpp:class:`hpx::parallel::task_block` based on the changes in the
  corresponding standardization proposal |cpp11_n4088|_.
* Added extensions to the parallel facility
  :cpp:class:`hpx::parallel::task_block` allowing to combine a task_block with
  an execution policy. This implies a minor breaking change as the
  ``hpx::parallel::task_block`` is now a template.
* Added new LCOs: ``hpx::lcos::latch`` and ``hpx::lcos::local::latch`` which
  semantically conform to the proposed ``std::latch`` (see |cpp17_n4399|_).
* Added performance counters exposing data related to data transferred by
  input/output (filesystem) operations (thanks to Maciej Brodowicz).
* Added performance counters allowing to track the number of action invocations
  (local and remote invocations).
* Added new command line options `--hpx:print-counter-at <commandline>`_ and
  `--hpx:reset-counters <commandline>`_.
* The ``hpx::vector`` component has been renamed to ``hpx::partitioned_vector``
  to make it explicit that the underlying memory is not contiguous.
* Introduced a completely new and uniform higher-level parallelism API which is
  based on executors. All existing parallelism APIs have been adapted to this.
  We have added a large number of different executor types, such as a numa-aware
  executor, a this-thread executor, etc.
* Added support for the MingW toolchain on Windows (thanks to Eric Lemanissier).
* HPX now includes support for APEX, (Autonomic Performance Environment for
  eXascale). APEX is an instrumentation and software adaptation library that
  provides an interface to TAU profiling / tracing as well as runtime adaptation
  of HPX applications through policy definitions. For more information and
  documentation, please see `<https://github.com/UO-OACISS/xpress-apex>`_. To
  enable APEX at configuration time, specify ``-DHPX_WITH_APEX=On``. To also
  include support for TAU profiling, specify ``-DHPX_WITH_TAU=On`` and specify
  the ``-DTAU_ROOT``, ``-DTAU_ARCH`` and ``-DTAU_OPTIONS`` cmake parameters.
* We have implemented many more of the :ref:`parallel_algorithms`. Please see
  :hpx-issue:`1141` for the list of all available parallel algorithms (thanks to
  Daniel Bourgeois and John Biddiscombe for contributing their work).

Breaking changes
================

* We are moving into the direction of unifying managed and simple components. In
  order to stop exposing the old facilities, all examples have been converted to
  use the new classes. The breaking change in this release is that performance
  counters are now a :cpp:class:`hpx::components::component_base` instead of
  :cpp:class:`hpx::components::managed_component_base`.
* We removed the support for stackless threads. It turned out that there was no
  performance benefit when using stackless threads. As such, we decided to clean
  up our codebase. This feature was not documented.
* The CMake project name has changed from 'hpx' to 'HPX' for consistency and
  compatibility with naming conventions and other CMake projects. Generated
  config files go into <prefix>/lib/cmake/HPX and not <prefix>/lib/cmake/hpx.
* The macro ``HPX_REGISTER_MINIMAL_COMPONENT_FACTORY`` has been deprecated.
  Please use :c:macro:`HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT`.
  instead. The old macro will be removed in the next release.
* The obsolete distributing_factory and binpacking_factory components have been
  removed. The corresponding functionality is now provided by the
  :cpp:func:`hpx::new_()` API function in conjunction with the
  ``hpx::default_layout`` and ``hpx::binpacking`` distribution policies
  (:cpp:class:`hpx::components::default_distribution_policy` and
  :cpp:class:`hpx::components::binpacking_distribution_policy`)
* The API function ``hpx::new_colocated`` has been deprecated. Please use the
  consolidated API :cpp:func:`hpx::new_` in conjunction with the new
  ``hpx::colocated`` distribution policy
  (:cpp:class:`hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy`) instead. The
  old API function will still be available for at least one release of |hpx| if
  the configuration variable ``HPX_WITH_COLOCATED_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` is
  enabled.
* The API function ``hpx::async_colocated`` has been deprecated. Please use the
  consolidated API ``hpx::async`` in conjunction with the new ``hpx::colocated``
  distribution policy
  (:cpp:class:`hpx::components::colocating_distribution_policy`) instead. The
  old API function will still be available for at least one release of |hpx| if
  the configuration variable ``HPX_WITH_COLOCATED_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` is
  enabled.
* The obsolete remote_object component has been removed.
* Replaced the use of Boost.Serialization with our own solution. While the new
  version is mostly compatible with Boost.Serialization, this change requires
  some minor code modifications in user code. For more information, please see
  the corresponding `announcement
  <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.hpx.devel/196>`_ on the
  |stellar_list|_ mailing list.
* The names used by cmake to influence various configuration options have been
  unified. The new naming scheme relies on all configuration constants to start
  with ``HPX_WITH_...``, while the preprocessor constant which is used at build
  time starts with ``HPX_HAVE_...``. For instance, the former cmake command line
  ``-DHPX_MALLOC=...`` now has to be specified a ``-DHPX_WITH_MALLOC=...`` and
  will cause the preprocessor constant ``HPX_HAVE_MALLOC`` to be defined. The
  actual name of the constant (i.e. ``MALLOC``) has not changed. Please see the
  corresponding documentation for more details (:ref:`cmake_variables`).
* The ``get_gid()`` functions exposed by the component base classes
  ``hpx::components::server::simple_component_base``,
  ``hpx::components::server::managed_component_base``, and
  ``hpx::components::server::fixed_component_base`` have been replaced by two
  new functions: ``get_unmanaged_id()`` and ``get_id()``. To enable the old
  function name for backwards compatibility, use the cmake configuration option
  ``HPX_WITH_COMPONENT_GET_GID_COMPATIBILITY=On``.
* All functions which were named ``get_gid()`` but were returning
  ``hpx::id_type`` have been renamed to ``get_id()``. To enable the old function
  names for backwards compatibility, use the cmake configuration option
  ``HPX_WITH_COMPONENT_GET_GID_COMPATIBILITY=On``.
