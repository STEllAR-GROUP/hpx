General changes
===============

This point release fixes a couple of problems reported for the V1.9.0 release.
Most importantly, we fixed various occasional hanging during startup and shutdown
in distributed scenarios. We also added support for zero-copy serialization on
the receiving side to the TCP, MPI, and LCI parcelports. Last but not least, we
have added support for Visual Studio 2019 and gcc using MINGW on Windows.
