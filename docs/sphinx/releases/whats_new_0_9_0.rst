==========================
|hpx| V0.9.0 (Jul 5, 2012)
==========================

We have had roughly 800 commits since the last release and we have closed
approximately 80 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

General changes
===============

* Significant improvements made to the usability of |hpx| in large-scale,
  distributed environments.
* Renamed :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::packaged_task` to
  :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::packaged_action` to reflect the semantic differences to
  a packaged_task as defined by the |cpp11|_.
* |hpx| now exposes :cpp:class:`hpx::thread` which is compliant to the C++11
  std::thread type except that it (purely locally) represents an |hpx| thread.
  This new type does not expose any of the remote capabilities of the underlying
  |hpx|-thread implementation.
* The type :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::future` is now compliant to the C++11
  std::future<> type. This type can be used to synchronize both, local and
  remote operations. In both cases the control flow will 'return' to the future
  in order to trigger any continuation.
* The types :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::local::promise` and
  :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::local::packaged_task` are now compliant to the C++11
  ``std::promise<>`` and ``std::packaged_task<>`` types. These can be used to
  create a future representing local work only. Use the types
  :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::promise` and :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::packaged_action`
  to wrap any (possibly remote) action into a future.
* :cpp:class:`hpx::thread` and :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::future` are now
  cancelable.
* Added support for sequential and logic composition of
  :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::future`\ s. The member function
  :cpp:member:`hpx::lcos::future::when` permits futures to be sequentially
  composed. The helper functions :cpp:func:`hpx::wait_all`,
  :cpp:func:`hpx::wait_any`, and :cpp:func:`hpx::wait_n` can be used to wait for
  more than one future at a time.
* |hpx| now exposes :cpp:func:`hpx::apply` and :cpp:func:`hpx::async` as the
  preferred way of creating (or invoking) any deferred work. These functions are
  usable with various types of functions, function objects, and actions and
  provide a uniform way to spawn deferred tasks.
* |hpx| now utilizes :cpp:func:`hpx::util::bind` to (partially) bind local
  functions and function objects, and also actions. Remote bound actions can
  have placeholders as well.
* |hpx| continuations are now fully polymorphic. The class
  :cpp:class:`hpx::actions::forwarding_continuation` is an example of how the
  user can write is own types of continuations. It can be used to execute any
  function as an continuation of a particular action.
* Reworked the action invocation API to be fully conformant to normal functions.
  Actions can now be invoked using :cpp:func:`hpx::apply`,
  :cpp:func:`hpx::async`, or using the ``operator()`` implemented on actions.
  Actions themselves can now be cheaply instantiated as they do not have any
  members anymore.
* Reworked the lazy action invocation API. Actions can now be directly bound
  using :cpp:func:`hpx::util::bind` by passing an action instance as the first
  argument.
* A minimal |hpx| program now looks like this::

      #include <hpx/hpx_init.hpp>

      int hpx_main()
      {
          return hpx::finalize();
      }

      int main()
      {
          return hpx::init();
      }

  This removes the immediate dependency on the |boost_program_options|_ library.

  .. note::

     This minimal version of an |hpx| program does not support any of the
     default command line arguments (such as --help, or command line options
     related to PBS). It is suggested to always pass ``argc`` and ``argv`` to
     |hpx| as shown in the example below.

* In order to support those, but still not to depend on |boost_program_options|_,
  the minimal program can be written as::

      #include <hpx/hpx_init.hpp>

      // The arguments for hpx_main can be left off, which very similar to the
      // behavior of ``main()`` as defined by C++.
      int hpx_main(int argc, char* argv[])
      {
          return hpx::finalize();
      }

      int main(int argc, char* argv[])
      {
          return hpx::init(argc, argv);
      }

* Added performance counters exposing the number of component instances which
  are alive on a given locality.
* Added performance counters exposing then number of messages sent and received,
  the number of parcels sent and received, the number of bytes sent and
  received, the overall time required to send and receive data, and the overall
  time required to serialize and deserialize the data.
* Added a new component: :cpp:class:`hpx::components::binpacking_factory` which
  is equivalent to the existing
  :cpp:class:`hpx::components::distributing_factory` component, except that it
  equalizes the overall population of the components to create. It exposes two
  factory methods, one based on the number of existing instances of the
  component type to create, and one based on an arbitrary performance counter
  which will be queried for all relevant localities.
* Added API functions allowing to access elements of the diagnostic information
  embedded in the given exception: :cpp:func:`hpx::get_locality_id`,
  :cpp:func:`hpx::get_host_name`, :cpp:func:`hpx::get_process_id`,
  :cpp:func:`hpx::get_function_name`, :cpp:func:`hpx::get_file_name`,
  :cpp:func:`hpx::get_line_number`, :cpp:func:`hpx::get_os_thread`,
  :cpp:func:`hpx::get_thread_id`, and :cpp:func:`hpx::get_thread_description`.
