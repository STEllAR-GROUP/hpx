===========================
|hpx| V1.0.0 (Apr 24, 2017)
===========================

General changes
===============

Here are some of the main highlights and changes for this release (in no
particular order):

* Added the facility ``hpx::split_future`` which allows to convert a
  ``future<tuple<Ts...>>`` into a ``tuple<future<Ts>...>``. This functionality
  is not available when compiling |hpx| with VS2012.
* Added a new type of performance counter which allows to return a list of
  values for each invocation. We also added a first counter of this type which
  collects a histogram of the times between parcels being created.
* Added new LCOs: ``hpx::lcos::channel`` and ``hpx::lcos::local::channel`` which
  are very similar to the well known channel constructs used in the Go language.
* Added new performance counters reporting the amount of data handled by the
  networking layer on a action-by-action basis (please see :hpx-pr:`2289` for
  more details).
* Added a new facility ``hpx::lcos::barrier``, replacing the equally named older
  one. The new facility has a slightly changed API and is much more efficient.
  Most notable, the new facility exposes a (global) function
  ``hpx::lcos::barrier::synchronize()`` which represents a global barrier across
  all localities.
* We have started to add support for vectorization to our parallel algorithm
  implementations. This support depends on using an external library, currently
  either |vc| or |boost_simd|_. Please see :hpx-issue:`2333` for a list of
  currently supported algorithms. This is an experimental feature and its
  implementation and/or API might change in the future. Please see this
  `blog-post
  <http://stellar-group.org/2016/09/vectorized-cpp-parallel-algorithms-with-hpx/>`_
  for more information.
* The parameter sequence for the ``hpx::parallel::transform_reduce`` overload
  taking one iterator range has changed to match the changes this algorithm has
  undergone while being moved to C++17. The old overload can be still enabled at
  configure time by specifying ``-DHPX_WITH_TRANSFORM_REDUCE_COMPATIBILITY=On``
  to |cmake|.
* The algorithm ``hpx::parallel::inner_product`` has been renamed to
  ``hpx::parallel::transform_reduce`` to match the changes this algorithm has
  undergone while being moved to C++17. The old inner_product names can be still
  enabled at configure time by specifying
  ``-DHPX_WITH_TRANSFORM_REDUCE_COMPATIBILITY=On`` to |cmake|.
* Added versions of ``hpx::get_ptr`` taking client side representations for
  component instances as their parameter (instead of a global id).
* Added the helper utility
  ``hpx::performance_counters::performance_counter_set`` helping to encapsulate
  a set of performance counters to be managed concurrently.
* All execution policies and related classes have been renamed to be consistent
  with the naming changes applied for C++17. All policies now live in the
  namespace ``hpx::parallel::execution``. The ols names can be still enabled at
  configure time by specifying ``-DHPX_WITH_EXECUTION_POLICY_COMPATIBILITY=On``
  to |cmake|.
* The thread scheduling subsystem has undergone a major refactoring which
  results in significant performance improvements. We have also imroved the
  performance of creating ``hpx::future`` and of various facilities handling
  those.
* We have consolidated all of the code in HPX.Compute related to the integration
  of CUDA. ``hpx::partitioned_vector`` has been enabled to be usable with
  ``hpx::compute::vector`` which allows to place the partitions on one or more
  GPU devices.
* Added new performance counters exposing various internals of the thread
  scheduling subsystem, such as the current idle- and busy-loop counters and
  instantaneous scheduler utilization.
* Extended and improved the use of the ITTNotify hooks allowing to collect
  performance counter data and function annotation information from within the
  Intel Amplifier tool.

Breaking changes
================

* We have dropped support for the gcc compiler versions V4.6 and 4.7. The
  minimal gcc version we now test on is gcc V4.8.
* We have removed (default) support for ``boost::chrono`` in interfaces, uses of
  it have been replaced with ``std::chrono``. This facility can be still enabled
  at configure time by specifying ``-DHPX_WITH_BOOST_CHRONO_COMPATIBILITY=On``
  to |cmake|.
* The parameter sequence for the ``hpx::parallel::transform_reduce`` overload
  taking one iterator range has changed to match the changes this algorithm has
  undergone while being moved to C++17.
* The algorithm ``hpx::parallel::inner_product`` has been renamed to
  ``hpx::parallel::transform_reduce`` to match the changes this algorithm has
  undergone while being moved to C++17.
* the build options ``HPX_WITH_COLOCATED_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` and
  ``HPX_WITH_COMPONENT_GET_GID_COMPATIBILITY`` are now disabled by default. Please
  change your code still depending on the deprecated interfaces.
