|hpx| V0.9.10 (Mar 24, 2015)
============================

General changes
===============

This is the 12th official release of |hpx|. It coincides with the 7th
anniversary of the first commit to our source code repository. Since then, we
have seen over 12300 commits amounting to more than 220000 lines of C++ code.

The major focus of this release was to improve the reliability of large scale
runs. We believe to have achieved this goal as we now can reliably run |hpx|
applications on up to ~24k cores. We have also shown that HPX can be used with
success for symmetric runs (applications using both, host cores and Intel
Xeon/Phi coprocessors). This is a huge step forward in terms of the usability of
|hpx|. The main focus of this work involved isolating the causes of the
segmentation faults at start up and shut down. Many of these issues were
discovered to be the result of the suspension of threads which hold locks.

A very important improvement introduced with this release is the refactoring of
the code representing our parcel-port implementation. Parcel- ports can now be
implemented by 3rd parties as independent plugins which are dynamically loaded
at runtime (static linking of parcel-ports is also supported). This refactoring
also includes a massive improvement of the performance of our existing
parcel-ports. We were able to significantly reduce the networking latencies and
to improve the available networking bandwidth. Please note that in this release
we disabled the ibverbs and ipc parcel ports as those have not been ported to
the new plugin system yet (see :hpx-issue:`839`).

Another corner stone of this release is our work towards a complete
implementation of __cpp11_n4104__ (Working Draft, Technical Specification for
C++ Extensions for Parallelism). This document defines a set of parallel
algorithms to be added to the C++ standard library. We now have implemented
about 75% of all specified parallel algorithms (see [link
hpx.manual.parallel.parallel_algorithms Parallel Algorithms] for more details).
We also implemented some extensions to __cpp11_n4104__ allowing to invoke all of
the algorithms asynchronously.

This release adds a first implementation of ``hpx::vector`` which is a
distributed data structure closely aligned to the functionality of
``std::vector``. The difference is that ``hpx::vector`` stores the data in
partitions where the partitions can be distributed over different localities. We
started to work on allowing to use the parallel algorithms with ``hpx::vector``.
At this point we have implemented only a few of the parallel algorithms to
support distributed data structures (like ``hpx::vector``) for testing purposes
(see :hpx-issue:`1338` for a documentation of our progress).

Breaking changes
================

With this release we put a lot of effort into changing the code base to be more
compatible to C++11. These changes have caused the following issues for backward
compatibility:

* Move to Variadics- All of the API now uses variadic templates. However, this
  change required to modify the argument sequence for some of the exiting API
  functions (:cpp:func:`hpx::async_continue`, :cpp:func:`hpx::apply_continue`,
  :cpp:func:`hpx::when_each`, :cpp:func:`hpx::wait_each`, synchronous invocation
  of actions).
* Changes to Macros- We also removed the macros ``HPX_STD_FUNCTION`` and
  ``HPX_STD_TUPLE``. This shouldn't affect any user code as we replaced
  ``HPX_STD_FUNCTION`` with ``hpx::util::function_nonser`` which was the default
  expansion used for this macro. All |hpx| API functions which expect a
  ``hpx::util::function_nonser`` (or a ``hpx::util::unique_function_nonser``)
  can now be transparently called with a compatible ``std::function`` instead.
  Similarly, ``HPX_STD_TUPLE`` was replaced by its default expansion as well:
  ``hpx::util::tuple``.
* Changes to ``hpx::unique_future``- ``hpx::unique_future``, which was
  deprecated in the previous release for :cpp:func:`hpx::future` is now
  completely removed from |hpx|. This completes the transition to a completely
  standards conforming implementation of ``hpx::future``.
* Changes to Supported Compilers. Finally, in order to utilize more C++11
  semantics, we have officially dropped support for GCC 4.4 and MSVC 2012.
  Please see our :ref:`prerequisites` page for more details.
