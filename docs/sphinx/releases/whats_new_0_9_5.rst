===========================
|hpx| V0.9.5 (Jan 16, 2013)
===========================

We have had over 1000 commits since the last release and we have closed roughly
150 tickets (bugs, feature requests, etc.).

General changes
===============

This release is continuing along the lines of code and API consolidation, and
overall usability inprovements. We dedicated much attention to performance and
we were able to significantly improve the threading and networking subsystems.

We successfully ported |hpx| to the Android platform. |hpx| applications now not
only can run on mobile devices, but we support heterogeneous applications
running across architecture boundaries. At the Supercomputing Conference 2012 we
demonstrated connecting Android tablets to simulations running on a Linux
cluster. The Android tablet was used to query performance counters from the
Linux simulation and to steer its parameters.

We successfully ported |hpx| to Mac OSX (using the Clang compiler). Thanks to
Pyry Jahkola for contributing the corresponding patches. Please see the section
:ref:`macos_installation` for more details.

We made a special effort to make HPX usable in highly concurrent use cases. Many
of the HPX API functions which possibly take longer than 100 microseconds to
execute now can be invoked asynchronously. We added uniform support for
composing futures which simplifies to write asynchronous code. HPX actions
(function objects encapsulating possibly concurrent remote function invocations)
are now well integrated with all other API facilities such like ``hpx::bind``.

All of the API has been aligned as much as possible with established paradigms.
HPX now mirrors many of the facilities as defined in the |cpp11|, such as
``hpx::thread``, ``hpx::function``, ``hpx::future``, etc.

A lot of work has been put into improving the documentation. Many of the API
functions are documented now, concepts are explained in detail, and examples are
better described than before. The new documentation index enables finding
information with lesser effort.

This is the first release of HPX we perform after the move to |hpx_github|_ This
step has enabled a wider participation from the community and further encourages
us in our decision to release HPX as a true open source library (HPX is licensed
under the very liberal |boost_license|_).
