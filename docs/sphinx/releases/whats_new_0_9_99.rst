============================
|hpx| V0.9.99 (Jul 15, 2016)
============================

General changes
===============

As the version number of this release hints, we consider this release to be a
preview for the upcoming |hpx| V1.0. All of the functionalities we set out to
implement for V1.0 are in place; all of the features we wanted to have exposed
are ready. We are very happy with the stability and performance of |hpx| and we
would like to present this release to the community in order for us to gather
broad feedback before releasing V1.0. We still expect for some minor details to
change, but on the whole this release represents what we would like to have in a
V1.0.

Overall, since the last release we have had almost 1600 commits while closing
almost 400 tickets. These numbers reflect the incredible development activity we
have seen over the last couple of months. We would like to express a big 'Thank
you!' to all contributors and those who helped to make this release happen.

The most notable addition in terms of new functionality available with this
release is the full implementation of object migration (i.e. the ability to
transparently move |hpx| components to a different compute node). Additionally,
this release of |hpx| cleans up many minor issues and some API inconsistencies.

Here are some of the main highlights and changes for this release (in no
particular order):

* We have fixed a couple of issues in AGAS and the parcel layer which have
  caused hangs, segmentation faults at exit, and a slowdown of applications over
  time. Fixing those has significantly increased the overall stability and
  performance of distributed runs.
* We have started to add parallel algorithm overloads based on the C++
  Extensions for Ranges (|cpp17_n4560|_) proposal. This also includes the
  addition of projections to the existing algorithms. Please see
  :hpx-issue:`1668` for a list of algorithms which have been adapted to
  |cpp17_n4560|_.
* We have implemented index-based parallel for-loops based on a corresponding
  standardization proposal (|cpp20_p0075r1|_). Please see :hpx-issue:`2016` for
  a list of available algorithms.
* We have added implementations for more parallel algorithms as proposed for the
  upcoming C++ 17 Standard. See :hpx-issue:`1141` for an overview of which
  algorithms are available by now.
* We have started to implement a new prototypical functionality with
  |hpx_compute| which uniformly exposes some of the higher level APIs to
  heterogeneous architectures (currently CUDA). This functionality is an early
  preview and should not be considered stable. It may change considerably in the
  future.
* We have pervasively added (optional) executor arguments to all API functions
  which schedule new work. Executors are now used throughout the code base as
  the main means of executing tasks.
* Added ``hpx::make_future<R>(future<T> &&)`` allowing to convert a future of
  any type ``T`` into a future of any other type ``R``, either based on default
  conversion rules of the embedded types or using a given explicit conversion
  function.
* We finally finished the implementation of transparent migration of components
  to another locality. It is now possible to trigger a migration operation
  without 'stopping the world' for the object to migrate. |hpx| will make sure
  that no work is being performed on an object before it is migrated and that
  all subsequently scheduled work for the migrated object will be transparently
  forwarded to the new locality. Please note that the global id of the migrated
  object does not change, thus the application will not have to be changed in
  any way to support this new functionality. Please note that this feature is
  currently considered experimental. See :hpx-issue:`559` and :hpx-pr:`1966` for
  more details.
* The ``hpx::dataflow`` facility is now usable with actions. Similarly to
  ``hpx::async``, actions can be specified as an explicit template argument
  (``hpx::dataflow<Action>(target, ...)``) or as the first argument
  (``hpx::dataflow(Action(), target, ...)``). We have also enabled the use of
  distribution policies as the target for dataflow invocations. Please see
  :hpx-issue:`1265` and :hpx-pr:`1912` for more information.
* Adding overloads of ``gather_here`` and ``gather_there`` to accept the plain
  values of the data to gather (in addition to the existing overloads expecting
  futures).
* We have cleaned up and refactored large parts of the code base. This helped
  reducing compile and link times of |hpx| itself and also of applications
  depending on it. We have further decreased the dependency of |hpx| on the
  Boost libraries by replacing part of those with facilities available from the
  standard libraries.
* Wherever possible we have removed dependencies of our API on Boost by
  replacing those with the equivalent facility from the C++11 standard library.
* We have added new performance counters for parcel coalescing, file-IO, the
  AGAS cache, and overall scheduler time. Resetting performance counters has
  been overhauled and fixed.
* We have introduced a generic client type ``hpx::components::client<>`` and
  added support for using it with ``hpx::async``. This removes the necessity to
  implement specific client types for every component type without losing type
  safety. This deemphasizes the need for using the low level ``hpx::id_type``
  for referencing (possibly remote) component instances. The plan is to
  deprecate the direct use of ``hpx::id_type`` in user code in the future.
* We have added a special iterator which supports automatic prefetching of one
  or more arrays for speeding up loop-like code (see
  ``hpx::parallel::util::make_prefetcher_context()``).
* We have extended the interfaces exposed from executors (as proposed by
  |cpp11_n4406|_) to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.

Breaking changes
================

* In order to move the dataflow facility to ``namespace hpx`` we added a
  definition of ``hpx::dataflow`` which might create ambiguities in existing
  codes. The previous definition of this facility (``hpx::lcos::local::dataflow``)
  has been deprecated and is available only if the constant
  ``-DHPX_WITH_LOCAL_DATAFLOW_COMPATIBILITY=On`` to |cmake|_ is defined at
  configuration time.
  Please explicitly qualify all uses of the dataflow facility if you enable
  this compatibility setting and encounter ambiguities.
* The adaptation of the C++ Extensions for Ranges (|cpp17_n4560|_) proposal
  imposes some breaking changes related to the return types of some of the
  parallel algorithms. Please see :hpx-issue:`1668` for a list of algorithms which
  have already been adapted.
* The facility ``hpx::lcos::make_future_void()`` has been replaced by
  ``hpx::make_future<void>()``.
* We have removed support for Intel V13 and gcc 4.4.x.
* We have removed (default) support for the generic
  ``hpx::parallel::execution_poliy`` because it was removed from the Parallelism
  TS (__cpp11_n4104__) while it was being added to the upcoming C++17 Standard.
  This facility can be still enabled at configure time by specifying
  ``-DHPX_WITH_GENERIC_EXECUTION_POLICY=On`` to |cmake|.
* Uses of ``boost::shared_ptr`` and related facilities have been replaced with
  ``std::shared_ptr`` and friends. Uses of ``boost::unique_lock``,
  ``boost::lock_guard`` etc. have also been replaced by the equivalent (and
  equally named) tools available from the C++11 standard library.
* Facilities that used to expect an explicit ``boost::unique_lock`` now take an
  ``std::unique_lock``. Additionally, ``condition_variable`` no longer aliases
  ``condition_variable_any``; its interface now only works with
  ``std::unique_lock<local::mutex>``.
* Uses of ``boost::function``, ``boost::bind``, ``boost::tuple`` have been replaced
  by the corresponding facilities in |hpx| (``hpx::util::function``,
  ``hpx::util::bind``, and ``hpx::util::tuple``, respectively).
