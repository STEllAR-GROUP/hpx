===========================
|hpx| V1.1.0 (Mar 24, 2018)
===========================

General changes
===============

Here are some of the main highlights and changes for this release (in no
particular order):

* We have changed the way |hpx| manages the processing units on a node. We do
  not longer implicitly bind all available cores to a single thread pool. The
  user has now full control over what processing units are bound to what thread
  pool, each with a separate scheduler. It is now also possible to create your
  own scheduler implementation and control what processing units this scheduler
  should use. We added the ``hpx::resource::partitioner`` that manages all
  available processing units and assigns resources to the used thread pools.
  Thread pools can be now be suspended/resumed independently. This functionality
  helps in running |hpx| concurrently to code that is directly relying on
  |openmp|_ and/or |mpi|_.
* We have continued to implement various parallel algorithms. |hpx| now almost
  completely implements all of the parallel algorithms as specified by the
  |cpp17|_. We have also continued to implement these algorithms for the
  distributed use case (for segmented data structures, such as
  ``hpx::partitioned_vector``).
* Added a compatibility layer for ``std::thread``, ``std::mutex``, and
  ``std::condition_variable`` allowing for the code to use those facilities
  where available and to fall back to the corresponding Boost facilities
  otherwise. The |cmake|_ configuration option
  ``-DHPX_WITH_THREAD_COMPATIBILITY=On`` can be used to force using the Boost
  equivalents.
* The parameter sequence for the ``hpx::parallel::transform_inclusive_scan``
  overload taking one iterator range has changed (again) to match the changes
  this algorithm has undergone while being moved to C++17. The old overloads can
  be still enabled at configure time by passing
  ``-DHPX_WITH_TRANSFORM_REDUCE_COMPATIBILITY=On`` to |cmake|_.
* The parameter sequence for the ``hpx::parallel::inclusive_scan`` overload
  taking one iterator range has changed to match the changes this algorithm has
  undergone while being moved to C++17. The old overloads can be still enabled
  at configure time by passing ``-DHPX_WITH_INCLUSIVE_SCAN_COMPATIBILITY=On`` to
  |cmake|.
* Added a helper facility ``hpx::local_new`` which is equivalent to
  ``hpx::new_`` except that it creates components locally only. As a
  consequence, the used component constructor may accept non-serializable
  argument types and/or non-const references or pointers.
* Removed the (broken) component type ``hpx::lcos::queue<T>``. The old type is
  still available at configure time by passing
  ``-DHPX_WITH_QUEUE_COMPATIBILITY=On`` to |cmake|.
* The parallel algorithms adopted for C++17 restrict the iterator categories
  usable with those to at least forward iterators. Our implementation of the
  parallel algorithms was supporting input iterators (and output iterators) as
  well by simply falling back to sequential execution. We have now made our
  implementations conforming by requiring at least forward iterators. In order
  to enable the old behavior use the the compatibility option
  ``-DHPX_WITH_ALGORITHM_INPUT_ITERATOR_SUPPORT=On`` on the |cmake|_ command
  line.
* We have added the functionalities allowing for LCOs being implemented using
  (simple) components. Before LCOs had to always be implemented using managed
  components.
* User defined components don't have to be default-constructible anymore. Return
  types from actions don't have to be default-constructible anymore either. Our
  serialization layer now in general supports non-default-constructible types.
* We have added a new launch policy ``hpx::launch::lazy`` that allows to defer
  the decision on what launch policy to use to the point of execution. This
  policy is initialized with a function (object) that -- when invoked -- is
  expected to produce the desired launch policy.

Breaking changes
================

* We have dropped support for the gcc compiler version V4.8. The minimal gcc
  version we now test on is gcc V4.9. The minimally required version of |cmake|_
  is now V3.3.2.
* We have dropped support for the Visual Studio 2013 compiler version. The
  minimal Visual Studio version we now test on is Visual Studio 2015.5.
* We have dropped support for the Boost V1.51-V1.54. The minimal version of
  Boost we now test is Boost V1.55.
* We have dropped support for the ``hpx::util::unwrapped`` API.
  ``hpx::util::unwrapped`` will stay functional to some degree, until it finally
  gets removed in a later version of HPX. The functional usage of
  ``hpx::util::unwrapped`` should be changed to the new
  ``hpx::util::unwrapping`` function whereas the immediate usage should be
  replaced to ``hpx::util::unwrap``.
* The performance counter names referring to properties as exposed by the
  threading subsystem have changes as those now additionally have to specify the
  thread-pool. See the corresponding documentation for more details.
* The overloads of ``hpx::async`` that invoke an action do not perform implicit
  unwrapping of the returned future anymore in case the invoked function does
  return a future in the first place. In this case ``hpx::async`` now returns a
  ``hpx::future<future<T>>`` making its behavior conforming to its local
  counterpart.
* We have replaced the use of ``boost::exception_ptr`` in our APIs with the
  equivalent ``std::exception_ptr``. Please change your codes accordingly. No
  compatibility settings are provided.
* We have removed the compatibility settings for
  ``HPX_WITH_COLOCATED_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` and
  ``HPX_WITH_COMPONENT_GET_GID_COMPATIBILITY`` as their life-cycle has reached
  its end.
* We have removed the experimental thread schedulers hierarchy_scheduler,
  periodic_priority_scheduler and throttling_scheduler in an effort to clean up
  and consolidate our thread schedulers.
