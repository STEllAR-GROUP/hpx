|hpx| V0.9.9 (Oct 31, 2014, codename Spooky)
============================================

General changes
===============

We have had over 1500 commits since the last release and we have closed over 200
tickets (bugs, feature requests, pull requests, etc.). These are by far the
largest numbers of commits and resolved issues for any of the |hpx| releases so
far. We are especially happy about the large number of people who contributed
for the first time to |hpx|.

* We completed the transition from the older (non-conforming) implementation of
  ``hpx::future`` to the new and fully conforming version by removing the old
  code and by renaming the type ``hpx::unique_future`` to ``hpx::future``. In
  order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing code which uses the
  type ``hpx::unique_future`` we support the configuration variable
  ``HPX_UNIQUE_FUTURE_ALIAS``. If this variable is set to ``ON`` while running
  cmake it will additionally define a template alias for this type.
* We rewrote and significantly changed our build system. Please have a look at
  the new (now generated) documentation here: :ref:`hpx_build_system`. Please
  revisit your build scripts to adapt to the changes. The most notable changes
  are:

   * ``HPX_NO_INSTALL`` is no longer necessary.
   * For external builds, you need to set ``HPX_DIR`` instead of ``HPX_ROOT`` as
     described here: :ref:`using_hpx_cmake`.
   * IDEs that support multiple configurations (Visual Studio and XCode) can now
     be used as intended. that means no build dir.
   * Building HPX statically (without dynamic libraries) is now supported
     (``-DHPX_STATIC_LINKING=On``).
   * Please note that many variables used to configure the build process have
     been renamed to unify the naming conventions (see the section
     :ref:`cmake_variables` for more information).
   * This also fixes a long list of issues, for more information see
     :hpx-issue:`1204`.
* We started to implement various proposals to the C++ Standardization committee
  related to parallelism and concurrency, most notably |cpp11_n4104|_ (Working
  Draft, Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Parallelism),
  |cpp11_n4088|_ (Task Region Rev. 3), and |cpp11_n4107|_ (Working Draft,
  Technical Specification for C++ Extensions for Concurrency).
* We completely remodeled our automatic build system to run builds and unit
  tests on various systems and compilers. This allows us to find most bugs right
  as they were introduced and helps to maintain a high level of quality and
  compatibility. The newest build logs can be found at |hpx_buildbot|_.
