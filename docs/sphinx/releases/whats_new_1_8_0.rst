===========================
|hpx| V1.8.0 (May 11, 2022)
===========================

With HPX parallel algorithms been fully adapted to C++20 the new release
achieves full conformance with C++20 concurrency and parallelism facilities. HPX
now supports all of the algorithms as specified by C++20. We have added support
for vectorization to more of our algorithms. Much work has been done towards
implementing |p2300| ("std::execution") and implementing the underlying
senders/receivers facilities. Finally, The new release comes with a brand new
documentation interface!

General changes
===============

- The new documentation can now be found on our webpage: https://hpx-docs.stellar-group.org.
  This includes a completely new and user-friendly interface environment along with
  restructuring of certain components. The content in the "Quick start", "Manual" and
  "Examples" was improved, while the "Build system" page was adapted to include necessary
  information for newcommers.
- With the vectorization support available in modern hardware architectures HPX
  now provides new data-parallel vector execution policies
  ``hpx::execution::simd`` and ``hpx::execution::par_simd`` that enable
  significant speed-up of our parallel algorithm implementations. The following
  algorithms now support SIMD execution:

  - ``copy``, ``copy_n``
  - ``generate``
  - ``adjacent_difference``, ``adjacent_find``
  - ``all_of``, ``any_of``, ``none_of``
  - ``equal``, ``mismatch``,
  - ``inner_product``
  - ``count``, ``count_if``
  - ``fill``, ``fill_n``
  - ``find``, ``find_end``, ``find_first_of``, ``find_if``, ``find_if_not``
  - ``for_each``, ``for_each_n``
  - ``generate``, ``generate_n``.

- Based on top of |p2300| the HPX parallel algorithms now support the pipeline
  syntax towards an effort to unify their usage along with senders/receivers.
  The HPX parallel algorithms can now bind with senders/receivers using the
  pipeline operator. 
- Several changes took place on the executors provided by HPX:
- The executors now support the ``num_cores`` options in order for the user to
  be able to specify the desired number of cores to be used in the correspodning
  execution.
- The ``scheduler`` executor was implemented on top of senders/receivers and can
  be used with all HPX facilities that schedule new work, such as parallel
  algorithms, ``hpx::async``, ``hpx::dataflow``, etc.
- The performance of ``fork_join_executor`` was improved.
- The following algorithms have been added/adapted to be C++20 conformant:

  - ``min_element``
  - ``max_element``
  - ``minmax_element``
  - ``starts_with``
  - ``ends_with``
  - ``swap_ranges``
  - ``unique``
  - ``unique_copy``
  - ``rotate``
  - ``rotate_copy``
  - ``sort``
  - ``shift_left``
  - ``shift_right``
  - ``stable_sort``
  - ``partition``
  - ``partition_copy``
  - ``stable_partition``
  - ``adjacent_difference``
  - ``nth_element``
  - ``partial_sort``
  - ``partial_sort_copy``.

- ``HPX_FORWARD``/``HPX_MOVE`` macros were introduced that replaced the
  ``std::move`` and ``std::forward`` facilities that in the library code.
- Hangs on distributed barrier were fixed.
- The performance of ``scan_partitioner`` was improved.
- Support was added for ``thread_priority`` to the ``parallel_execution_policy`` 
- Regarding senders/receivers and the |p2300| proposal various actions took place.
  ``stop_token`` was adapted to the recent proposal version
  (``in_place_stop_token`` was introduced). Also hint, annotation, priority and
  stacksize properties were added to the scheduler executor. Stop support was
  added to ``when_all``. Support for completion signatures was added. The
  following schedulers and algorithms were added:

  - ``get_completion_scheduler``
  - ``any_sender`` and ``unique_any_sender``
  - ``split`` sender
  - ``transform_mpi`` sender
  - ``transfer`` sender
  - ``let_error``, ``let_stopped``
  - ``get_env`` and related environment queries
  - ``schedule``, ``set_value``, ``set_error``, ``set_done``, ``start`` and
    ``connect`` are now proper customization points as defined in |p2300|.

- Several namespaces were altered towards conformance with C++20. Compatibility layers
  have been added and the old versions will be removed in next releases. The namespace
  changes are the following:

  - ``hpx::parallel::induction/reduction`` were movied into namespace ``hpx::experimental``
  - ``for_loop`` and friends were moved into namespace ``hpx::experimental``.
  - ``hpx::util::optional`` and friends were moved into namespace ``hpx``.
  - ``hpx::lcos::barrier`` has been moved into the ``hpx::distributed`` namespace and
    ``hpx::lcos::local::cpp20_barrier`` has been renamed to ``barrier`` and moved into
    the ``hpx`` namespace.
  - ``hpx::lcos::latch`` has been moved into the ``hpx::distributed`` namespace and
    ``lcos::local::latch`` has been moved into the ``hpx`` namespace. The
    ``count_down_and_wait()`` functionality of ``latch`` has been renamed to
    ``arrive_and_wait()``.
  - ``hpx::util::unique_function_nonser`` has been renamed to ``hpx::move_only_function``.
  - ``hpx::util::unique_function`` has been renamed to ``hpx::distributed::move_only_function``.

- The new LCI (Lightweight Communication Interface) parcelport was added that supports
  irregular and asynchronous applications like graph analysis, sparce linear algebra,
  modern parallel architectures etc. Major features include:

  - Support for advanced communication primitives like two sided send/recv and
  one sided remote put.
  - Better multi-threaded performance.
  - Explicit user control of communication resource.
  - Flexible signaling mechanisms (synchronizer, completion queue, active message handler). 

- The following CMake flags were added, mostly to support using HPX as a backend
  for SHAD (https://github.com/pnnl/SHAD). Please note that these options enable
  questionable functionalities, partially they even enable undefined behavior.
  Please only use any of them if you know what you're doing:

  - ``HPX_SERIALIZATION_WITH_ALLOW_RAW_POINTER_SERIALIZATION``
  - ``HPX_SERIALIZATION_WITH_ALL_TYPES_ARE_BITWISE_SERIALIZABLE``
