=============
Testing |hpx|
=============

To ensure correctness of |hpx| we ship a large variety of unit and regression
tests. The tests are driven by the |ctest|_ tool and are executed automatically
by buildbot (see |hpx_buildbot|_) on each commit to the |hpx| |hpx_github|_
repository. In addition, it is encouraged to run the test suite manually to
ensure proper operation on your target system. If a test fails for your
platform, we highly recommend submitting an issue on our |hpx_github_issues|_
tracker with detailed information about the target system.

Running tests manually
======================

Running the tests manually is as easy as typing ``make tests && make test``.
This will build all tests and run them once the tests are built successfully.
After the tests have been built, you can invoke separate tests with the help of
the ``ctest`` command. You can list all available test targets using ``make help
| grep tests``. Please see the |ctest_doc|_ for further details.

Issue tracker
=============

If you stumble over a bug or missing feature missing feature in |hpx| please
submit an issue to our |hpx_github_issues|_. For more information on how to
submit support requests or other means of getting in contact with the developers
please see the |support|_.

Continuous testing
==================

In addition to manual testing, we run automated tests on various platforms. You
can see the status of the current master head by visiting the
|hpx_buildbot|_. We also run tests on all pull requests using both
|circleci|_ and a combination of |cdash|_ and |pycicle|_. You can see the
dashboards here: |hpx_circleci|_ and |hpx_cdash|_ .
