Error handling
==============

Like in any other asynchronous invocation scheme it is important to be able to
handle error conditions occurring while the asynchronous (and possibly remote)
operation is executed. In |hpx| all error handling is based on standard C++
exception handling. Any exception thrown during the execution of an asynchronous
operation will be transferred back to the original invocation :term:`locality`,
where it is rethrown during synchronization with the calling thread.

The source code for this example can be found here:
:download:`error_handling.cpp <../../examples/quickstart/error_handling.cpp>`.

.. _exceptions:

Working with exceptions
-----------------------

For the following description we assume that the function ``raise_exception()``
is executed by invoking the plain action ``raise_exception_type``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart/error_handling.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 13-17

The exception is thrown using the macro :c:macro:`HPX_THROW_EXCEPTION`. The type
of the thrown exception is :cpp:class:`hpx::exception`. This associates
additional diagnostic information with the exception, such as file name and line
number, :term:`locality` id and thread id, and stack backtrace from the point
where the exception was thrown.

Any exception thrown during the execution of an action is transferred back to
the (asynchronous) invocation site. It will be rethrown in this context when the
calling thread tries to wait for the result of the action by invoking either
``future<>::get()`` or the synchronous action invocation wrapper as shown here:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart/error_handling.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 27-42

.. note::

   The exception is transferred back to the invocation site even if it is
   executed on a different :term:`locality`.

Additionally, this example demonstrates how an exception thrown by an (possibly
remote) action can be handled. It shows the use of
:cpp:func:`hpx::diagnostic_information` which retrieves all available diagnostic
information from the exception as a formatted string. This includes, for
instance, the name of the source file and line number, the sequence number of
the OS-thread and the |hpx|-thread id, the :term:`locality` id and the stack
backtrace of the point where the original exception was thrown.

Under certain circumstances it is desirable to output only some of the
diagnostics, or to output those using different formatting. For this case, |hpx|
exposes a set of lower level functions as demonstrated in the following code
snippet:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart/error_handling.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 47-72

.. _error_code:

Working with error codes
------------------------

Most of the API functions exposed by |hpx| can be invoked in two different
modes. By default those will throw an exception on error as described above.
However, sometimes it is desirable not to throw an exception in case of an error
condition. In this case an object instance of the :cpp:class:`hpx::error_code`
type can be passed as the last argument to the API function. In case of an error
the error condition will be returned in that :cpp:class:`hpx::error_code`
instance. The following example demonstrates extracting the full diagnostic
information without exception handling:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart/error_handling.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 79-100

.. note::

   The error information is transferred back to the invocation site even if it
   is executed on a different :term:`locality`.

This example show how an error can be handled without having to resolve to
exceptions and that the returned :cpp:class:`hpx::error_code` instance can be
used in a very similar way as the :cpp:class:`hpx::exception` type above. Simply
pass it to the :cpp:func:`hpx::diagnostic_information` which retrieves all
available diagnostic information from the error code instance as a formatted
string.

As for handling exceptions, when working with error codes, under certain
circumstances it is desirable to output only some of the diagnostics, or to
output those using different formatting. For this case, |hpx| exposes a set of
lower level functions usable with error codes as demonstrated in the following
code snippet:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart/error_handling.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 107-139

For more information please refer to the documentation of
:cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_what`, :cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_locality_id`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_host_name`, :cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_process_id`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_function_name`, :cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_file_name`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_line_number`, :cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_os_thread`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_thread_id`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_thread_description`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_backtrace`, :cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_env`, and
:cpp:func:`hpx::get_error_state`.

.. _lightweight_error_code:

Lightweight error codes
-----------------------

Sometimes it is not desirable to collect all the ambient information about the
error at the point where it happened as this might impose too much overhead for
simple scenarios. In this case, |hpx| provides a lightweight error code facility
which will hold the error code only. The following snippet demonstrates its use:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart/error_handling.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 146-166

All functions which retrieve other diagnostic elements from the
:cpp:class:`hpx::error_code` will fail if called with a lightweight error_code
instance.

.. _utilities:

Utilities in |hpx|
==================

In order to ease the burden of programming in |hpx| we have provided several
utilities to users. The following section documents those facilies.

.. _checkpoint:

Checkpoint
----------

A common need of users is to periodically backup an application. This practice
provides resiliency and potential restart points in code. We have developed the
concept of a ``checkpoint`` to support this use case.

Found in ``hpx/util/checkpoint.hpp``, ``checkpoint``\ s are defined as objects
which hold a serialized version of an object or set of objects at a particular
moment in time. This representation can be stored in memory for later use or it
can be written to disk for storage and/or recovery at a later point. In order to
create and fill this object with data we use a function called
``save_checkpoint``. In code the function looks like this::

    hpx::future<hpx::util::checkpoint> hpx::util::save_checkpoint(a, b, c, ...);

``save_checkpoint`` takes arbitrary data containers such as int, double, float,
vector, and future and serializes them into a newly created ``checkpoint``
object. This function returns a ``future`` to a ``checkpoint`` containing the
data. Let us look a simple use case below::

    using hpx::util::checkpoint;
    using hpx::util::save_checkpoint;

    std::vector<int> vec{1,2,3,4,5};
    hpx::future<checkpoint> save_checkpoint(vec);

Once the future is ready the checkpoint object will contain the ``vector``
``vec`` and its five elements.

It is also possible to modify the launch policy used by ``save_checkpoint``.
This is accomplished by passing a launch policy as the first argument. It is
important to note that passing ``hpx::launch::sync`` will cause
``save_checkpoint`` to return a ``checkpoint`` instead of a ``future`` to a
``checkpoint``. All other policies passed to ``save_checkpoint`` will return a
``future`` to a ``checkpoint``.

Sometimes ``checkpoint`` s must be declared before they are used.
``save_checkpoint`` allows users to move pre-created ``checkpoint`` s into the
function as long as they are the first container passing into the function (In
the case where a launch policy is used, the ``checkpoint`` will immediately
follow the launch policy). An example of these features can be found below:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/unit/util/checkpoint.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 27-38

Now that we can create ``checkpoint`` s we now must be able to restore the
objects they contain into memory. This is accomplished by the function
``restore_checkpoint``. This function takes a ``checkpoint`` and fills its data
into the containers it is provided. It is important to remember that the
containers must be ordered in the same way they were placed into the
``checkpoint``. For clarity see the example below:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/unit/util/checkpoint.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 41-49

The core utility of ``checkpoint`` is in its ability to make certain data
persistent. Often this means that the data is needed to be stored in an object,
such as a file, for later use. For these cases we have provided two solutions:
stream operator overloads and access iterators.

We have created the two stream overloads
``operator<<`` and ``operator>>`` to stream data
out of and into ``checkpoint``. You can see an
example of the overloads in use below:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/unit/util/checkpoint.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 176-186

This is the primary way to move data into and out of a ``checkpoint``. It is
important to note, however, that users should be cautious when using a stream
operator to load data an another function to remove it (or vice versa). Both
``operator<<`` and ``operator>>`` rely on a ``.write()`` and a ``.read()``
function respectively. In order to know how much data to read from the
``std::istream``, the ``operator<<`` will write the size of the ``checkpoint``
before writing the ``checkpoint`` data. Correspondingly, the ``operator>>`` will
read the size of the stored data before reading the data into new instance of
``checkpoint``. As long as the user employs the ``operator<<`` and
``operator>>`` to stream the data this detail can be ignored.

.. important::

   Be careful when mixing ``operator<<`` and ``operator>>`` with other
   facilities to read and write to a ``checkpoint``. ``operator<<`` writes and
   extra variable and ``operator>>`` reads this variable back separately. Used
   together the user will not encounter any issues and can safely ignore this
   detail.

Users may also move the data into and out of a ``checkpoint`` using the exposed
``.begin()`` and ``.end()`` iterators. An example of this use case is
illustrated below.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/unit/util/checkpoint.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 129-150

.. _iostreams:

The |hpx| I/O-streams component
===============================

The |hpx| I/O-streams subsystem extends the standard C++ output streams
``std::cout`` and ``std::cerr`` to work in the distributed setting of an |hpx|
application. All of the output streamed to``hpx::cout``will be dispatched to
``std::cout`` on the console :term:`locality`. Likewise, all output generated
from ``hpx::cerr`` will be dispatched to ``std::cerr`` on the console
:term:`locality`.

.. note::

   All existing standard manipulators can be used in conjunction with
   ``hpx::cout`` and ``hpx::cerr`` Historically, |hpx| also defines
   ``hpx::endl`` and ``hpx::flush`` but those are just aliases for the
   corresponding standard manipulators.

In order to use either ``hpx::cout`` or ``hpx::cerr`` application codes need to
``#include <hpx/include/iostreams.hpp>``. For an example, please see the
simplest possible 'Hello world' program as included as an example with |hpx|:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart/simplest_hello_world_1.cpp
   :language: c++

Additionally those applications need to link with the iostreams component. When
using cmake this can be achieved by using the ``COMPONENT_DEPENDENCIES``
parameter, for instance:

.. code-block:: cmake

   include(HPX_AddExecutable)

   add_hpx_executable(
       simplest_hello_world
       SOURCES simplest_hello_world.cpp
       COMPONENT_DEPENDENCIES iostreams
   )

.. note::

   The ``hpx::cout`` and ``hpx::cerr`` streams buffer all output locally until a
   ``std::endl`` or ``std::flush`` is encountered. That means that no output
   will appear on the console as long as either of those is explicitly used.
