Configuring |hpx| applications
==============================

All |hpx| applications can be configured using special command line options
and/or using special configuration files. This section describes the available
options, the configuration file format, and the algorithm used to locate
possible predefined configuration files. Additionally this section describes the
defaults assumed if no external configuration information is supplied.

During startup any |hpx| application applies a predefined search pattern to
locate one or more configuration files. All found files will be read and merged
in the sequence they are found into one single internal database holding all
configuration properties. This database is used during the execution of the
application to configure different aspects of the runtime system.

In addition to the ini files, any application can supply its own configuration
files, which will be merged with the configuration database as well. Moreover,
the user can specify additional configuration parameters on the command line
when executing an application. The |hpx| runtime system will merge all command
line configuration options (see the description of the :option:`--hpx:ini`,
:option:`--hpx:config`, and :option:`--hpx:app-config` command line options).

.. _ini_format:

The |hpx| INI File Format
-------------------------

All |hpx| applications can be configured using a special file format which is
similar to the well-known |ini_file_format|_. This is a structured text format
allowing to group key/value pairs (properties) into sections. The basic element
contained in an ini file is the property. Every property has a name and a
value, delimited by an equals sign ``'='``. The name appears to the left of the
equals sign:

.. code-block:: ini

   name=value

The value may contain equal signs as only the first ``'='`` character
is interpreted as the delimiter between ``name`` and ``value`` Whitespace before
the name, after the value and immediately before and after the delimiting equal
sign is ignored. Whitespace inside the value is retained.

Properties may be grouped into arbitrarily named sections. The section name
appears on a line by itself, in square brackets ``[`` and ``]``. All properties
after the section declaration are associated with that section. There is no
explicit "end of section" delimiter; sections end at the next section
declaration, or the end of the file:

.. code-block:: ini

   [section]

In |hpx| sections can be nested. A nested section has a name composed of
all section names it is embedded in. The section names are concatenated using
a dot ``'.'``:

.. code-block:: ini

   [outer_section.inner_section]

Here ``inner_section`` is logically nested within ``outer_section``.

It is possible to use the full section name concatenated with the property
name to refer to a particular property. For example in:

.. code-block:: ini

    [a.b.c]
    d = e

the property value of ``d`` can be referred to as ``a.b.c.d=e``.

In |hpx| ini files can contain comments. Hash signs ``'#'`` at the beginning
of a line indicate a comment. All characters starting with the ``'#'`` until the
end of line are ignored.

If a property with the same name is reused inside a section, the second
occurrence of this property name will override the first occurrence (discard the
first value). Duplicate sections simply merge their properties together, as if
they occurred contiguously.

In |hpx| ini files, a property value ``${FOO:default}`` will use the environmental
variable ``FOO`` to extract the actual value if it is set and ``default`` otherwise.
No default has to be specified. Therefore ``${FOO}`` refers to the environmental
variable ``FOO``. If ``FOO`` is not set or empty the overall expression will evaluate
to an empty string. A property value ``$[section.key:default]`` refers to the value
held by the property ``section.key`` if it exists and ``default`` otherwise. No
default has to be specified. Therefore ``$[section.key]`` refers to the property
``section.key``. If the property ``section.key`` is not set or empty, the overall
expression will evaluate to an empty string.

.. note::

   Any property ``$[section.key:default]`` is evaluated whenever it is queried
   and not when the configuration data is initialized. This allows for lazy
   evaluation and relaxes initialization order of different sections. The only
   exception are recursive property values, e.g. values referring to the very
   key they are associated with. Those property values are evaluated at
   initialization time to avoid infinite recursion.

.. _config_defaults:

Built-in Default Configuration Settings
---------------------------------------

During startup any |hpx| application applies a predefined search pattern to
locate one or more configuration files. All found files will be read and merged
in the sequence they are found into one single internal data structure holding
all configuration properties.

As a first step the internal configuration database is filled with a set of
default configuration properties. Those settings are described on a section
by section basis below.

.. note::

   You can print the default configuration settings used for an executable
   by specifying the command line option :option:`--hpx:dump-config`.

       a dedicated :term:`AGAS` server :term:`locality`.

Additionally, the section ``hpx.components`` will be populated with the
information gathered from all found components. The information loaded for each
of the components will contain at least the following properties:

.. code-block:: ini

    [hpx.components.<component_instance_name>]
    name = <component_name>
    path = <full_path_of_the_component_module>
    enabled = $[hpx.components.load_external]

       to the macro used while registering the component with
       :c:macro:`HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT`. Set by the component factory.
   * * ``hpx.components.<component_instance_name>.path``
     * This is either the full path file name of the component module or the

       optional property, |hpx| assumed that the component is enabled if it is
       not defined.

The value for ``<component_instance_name>`` is usually the same as for the
corresponding ``name`` property. However generally it can be defined to any
arbitrary instance name. It is used to distinguish between different ini
sections, one for each component.

     * Enable the use of the default TCP parcelport. Note that the initial
       bootstrap of the overall |hpx| application will be performed using the
       default TCP connections. This parcelport is enabled by default. This will
       be disabled only if MPI is enabled (see below).
   * * ``hpx.parcel.tcp.array_optimization``
     * This property defines whether this :term:`locality` is allowed to utilize
       array optimizations in the TCP/IP parcelport during serialization of
       parcel data. The default is the same value as set for
       ``hpx.parcel.array_optimization``.
   * * ``hpx.parcel.tcp.zero_copy_optimization``
     * This property defines whether this :term:`locality` is allowed to utilize
       zero copy optimizations in the TCP/IP parcelport during serialization of
       parcel data. The default is the same value as set for
       ``hpx.parcel.zero_copy_optimization``.
   * * ``hpx.parcel.tcp.async_serialization``
     * This property defines whether this :term:`locality` is allowed to spawn a
       new thread for serialization in the TCP/IP parcelport (this is both for
       encoding and decoding parcels). The default is the same value as set for
       ``hpx.parcel.async_serialization``.
   * * ``hpx.parcel.tcp.parcel_pool_size``
     * The value of this property defines the number of OS-threads created for
       the internal parcel thread pool of the TCP :term:`parcel` port. The default is
       taken from ``hpx.threadpools.parcel_pool_size``.
   * * ``hpx.parcel.tcp.max_connections``
     * This property defines how many network connections between different
       localities are overall kept alive by each of :term:`locality`. The
       default is taken from ``hpx.parcel.max_connections``.
   * * ``hpx.parcel.tcp.max_connections_per_locality``
     * This property defines the maximum number of network connections that one
       :term:`locality` will open to another :term:`locality`. The default is

   * * ``hpx.parcel.tcp.max_message_size``
     * This property defines the maximum allowed message size which will be
       transferable through the :term:`parcel` layer. The default is taken from
       ``hpx.parcel.max_message_size``.
   * * ``hpx.parcel.tcp.max_outbound_message_size``
     * This property defines the maximum allowed outbound coalesced message size
       which will be transferable through the :term:`parcel` layer. The default is
       taken from ``hpx.parcel.max_outbound_connections``.

The following settings relate to the MPI parcelport. These settings take effect
only if the compile time constant ``HPX_HAVE_PARCELPORT_MPI`` is set (the
equivalent cmake variable is ``HPX_WITH_PARCELPORT_MPI`` and has to be set to
``ON``.

.. _ini_hpx_agas:

.. list-table::

   * * Property
     * Description
   * * ``hpx.agas.address``
     * This property defines the default IP address to be used for the
       :term:`AGAS` root server. This IP address will be used as long as no
       other values are specified (for instance using the :option:`--hpx:agas`
       command line option). The expected format is any valid IP address or
       domain name format which can be resolved into an IP address. The default
       depends on the compile time preprocessor constant
       ``HPX_INITIAL_IP_ADDRESS`` (``"127.0.0.1"``).
   * * ``hpx.agas.port``
     * This property defines the default IP port to be used for the :term:`AGAS`
       root server. This IP port will be used as long as no other values are
       specified (for instance using the :option:`--hpx:agas` command line
       option). The default depends on the compile time preprocessor constant
       ``HPX_INITIAL_IP_PORT`` (``7009``).
   * * ``hpx.agas.service_mode``
     * This property specifies what type of :term:`AGAS` service is running on
       this :term:`locality`. Currently, two modes exist. The :term:`locality`
       that acts as the :term:`AGAS` server runs in ``bootstrap`` mode. All other
       localities are in ``hosted`` mode.
   * * ``hpx.agas.dedicated_server``
     * This property specifies whether the :term:`AGAS` server is exclusively
       running :term:`AGAS` services and not hosting any application components.
       It is a boolean value. Set to ``1`` if
       :option:`--hpx:run-agas-server-only` is present.
   * * ``hpx.agas.max_pending_refcnt_requests``
     * This property defines the number of reference counting requests
       (increments or decrements) to buffer. The default depends on the compile
       time preprocessor constant
       ``HPX_INITIAL_AGAS_MAX_PENDING_REFCNT_REQUESTS`` (``4096``).
   * * ``hpx.agas.use_caching``
     * This property specifies whether a software address translation cache is
       used. It is a boolean value. Defaults to ``1``.
   * * ``hpx.agas.use_range_caching``
     * This property specifies whether range-based caching is used by the
       software address translation cache. This property is ignored if
       `hpx.agas.use_caching` is false. It is a boolean value. Defaults to ``1``.
   * * ``hpx.agas.local_cache_size``
     * This property defines the size of the software address translation cache
       for :term:`AGAS` services. This property is ignored
       if ``hpx.agas.use_caching`` is false. Note that if
       ``hpx.agas.use_range_caching`` is true, this size will refer to the
       maximum number of ranges stored in the cache, not the number of entries
       spanned by the cache. The default depends on the compile time
       preprocessor constant ``HPX_AGAS_LOCAL_CACHE_SIZE`` (``4096``).

.. _loading_ini_files:

Loading INI files
-----------------

During startup and after the internal database has been initialized as
described in the section :ref:`config_defaults`, |hpx| will try to locate and
load additional ini files to be used as a source for configuration properties.
This allows for a wide spectrum of additional customization possibilities by
the user and system administrators. The sequence of locations where |hpx|
will try loading the ini files is well defined and documented in this section.
All ini files found are merged into the internal configuration database.
The merge operation itself conforms to the rules as described in the section
:ref:`ini_format`.

#. Load all component shared libraries found in the directories specified by the
   property ``hpx.component_path`` and retrieve their default configuration
   information (see section :ref:`loading_components` for more details). This
   property can refer to a list of directories separated by ``':'`` (Linux,
   Android, and MacOS) or using ``';'`` (Windows).
#. Load all files named ``hpx.ini`` in the directories referenced by the property
   ``hpx.master_ini_path`` This property can refer to a list of directories
   separated by ``':'`` (Linux, Android, and MacOS) or using ``';'`` (Windows).
#. Load a file named ``.hpx.ini`` in the current working directory, e.g. the
   directory the application was invoked from.
#. Load a file referenced by the environment variable ``HPX_INI``. This variable
   is expected to provide the full path name of the ini configuration file (if
   any).
#. Load a file named ``/etc/hpx.ini``. This lookup is done on non-Windows systems
   only.
#. Load a file named ``.hpx.ini`` in the home directory of the current user,
   e.g. the directory referenced by the environment variable ``HOME``.
#. Load a file named ``.hpx.ini`` in the directory referenced by the environment
   variable ``PWD``.
#. Load the file specified on the command line using the option
   :option:`--hpx:config`.
#. Load all properties specified on the command line using the option
   :option:`--hpx:ini`. The properties will be added to the database in the
   same sequence as they are specified on the command line. The format for those
   options is for instance :option:`--hpx:ini`\ ``=hpx.default_stack_size=0x4000``. In
   addition to the explicit command line options, this will set the following
   properties as implied from other settings:

   * ``hpx.parcel.address`` and ``hpx.parcel.port`` as set by
     :option:`--hpx:hpx`
   * ``hpx.agas.address``, ``hpx.agas.port`` and ``hpx.agas.service_mode`` as
     set by :option:`--hpx:agas`
   * ``hpx.program_name`` and ``hpx.cmd_line`` will be derived from the actual
     command line
   * ``hpx.os_threads`` and ``hpx.localities`` as set by
      :option:`--hpx:threads` and :option:`--hpx:localities`
   * ``hpx.runtime_mode`` will be derived from any explicit
     :option:`--hpx:console`, :option:`--hpx:worker`, or :option:`--hpx:connect`,
     or it will be derived from other settings, such as :option:`--hpx:node`
     ``=0`` which implies :option:`--hpx:console`
#. Load files based on the pattern ``*.ini`` in all directories listed by the
   property ``hpx.ini_path``. All files found during this search will be merged.
   The property ``hpx.ini_path`` can hold a list of directories separated by
   ``':'`` (on Linux or Mac) or ``';'`` (on Windows).
#. Load the file specified on the command line using the option
   :option:`--hpx:app-config`. Note that this file will be merged as the content
   for a top level section ``[application]``.

.. note::

   Any changes made to the configuration database caused by one of the steps
   will influence the loading process for all subsequent steps. For instance, if
   one of the ini files loaded changes the property ``hpx.ini_path`` this will
   influence the directories searched in step 9 as described above.

.. important::

   The |hpx| core library will verify that all configuration settings specified
   on the command line (using the :option:`--hpx:ini` option) will be checked
   for validity. That means that the library will accept only *known*
   configuration settings. This is to protect the user from unintentional typos
   while specifying those settings. This behavior can be overwritten by
   appending a ``'!'`` to the configuration key, thus forcing the setting to be
   entered into the configuration database, for instance: :option:`--hpx:ini`\
   ``=hpx.foo! = 1``

If any of the environment variables or files listed above is not found the
corresponding loading step will be silently skipped.

.. _loading_components:

Loading components
==================

|hpx| relies on loading application specific components during the runtime of an
application. Moreover, |hpx| comes with a set of preinstalled components
supporting basic functionalities useful for almost every application. Any
component in |hpx| is loaded from a shared library, where any of the shared
libraries can contain more than one component type. During startup, |hpx| tries
to locate all available components (e.g. their corresponding shared libraries)
and creates an internal component registry for later use. This section describes
the algorithm used by |hpx| to locate all relevant shared libraries on a system.
As described, this algorithm is customizable by the configuration properties
loaded from the ini files (see section :ref:`loading_ini_files`).

Loading components is a two stage process. First |hpx| tries to locate all
component shared libraries, loads those, and generates default configuration
section in the internal configuration database for each component found. For
each found component the following information is generated:

.. code-block:: ini

    [hpx.components.<component_instance_name>]
    name = <name_of_shared_library>
    path = $[component_path]
    enabled = $[hpx.components.load_external]
    default = 1

The values in this section correspond to the expected configuration information
for a component as described in the section :ref:`config_defaults`.

In order to locate component shared libraries, |hpx| will try loading all
shared libraries (files with the platform specific extension of a shared
library, Linux: ``*.so``, Windows: ``*.dll``, MacOS: ``*.dylib`` found in the
directory referenced by the ini property ``hpx.component_path``).

This first step corresponds to step 1) during the process of filling the
internal configuration database with default information as described in section
:ref:`loading_ini_files`.

After all of the configuration information has been loaded, |hpx| performs the
second step in terms of loading components. During this step, |hpx| scans all
existing configuration sections
``[hpx.component.<some_component_instance_name>]`` and instantiates a special
factory object for each of the successfully located and loaded components.
During the application's life time, these factory objects will be responsible to
create new and discard old instances of the component they are associated with.
This step is performed after step 11) of the process of filling the internal
configuration database with default information as described in section
:ref:`loading_ini_files`.

.. _component_example:

Application specific component example
--------------------------------------

In this section we assume to have a simple application component which exposes
one member function as a component action. The header file ``app_server.hpp``
declares the C++ type to be exposed as a component. This type has a member
function ``print_greeting()`` which is exposed as an action
``print_greeting_action``. We assume the source files for this example are
located in a directory referenced by ``$APP_ROOT``:

.. code-block:: c++

   // file: $APP_ROOT/app_server.hpp
   #include <hpx/hpx.hpp>
   #include <hpx/include/iostreams.hpp>

   namespace app
   {
       // Define a simple component exposing one action 'print_greeting'
       class HPX_COMPONENT_EXPORT server
         : public hpx::components::component_base<server>
       {
           void print_greeting ()
           {
               hpx::cout << "Hey, how are you?\n" << hpx::flush;
           }

           // Component actions need to be declared, this also defines the
           // type 'print_greeting_action' representing the action.
           HPX_DEFINE_COMPONENT_ACTION(server, print_greeting, print_greeting_action);
       };
   }

   // Declare boilerplate code required for each of the component actions.
   HPX_REGISTER_ACTION_DECLARATION(app::server::print_greeting_action);

The corresponding source file contains mainly macro invocations which define
boilerplate code needed for |hpx| to function properly:

.. code-block:: c++

   // file: $APP_ROOT/app_server.cpp
   #include "app_server.hpp"

   // Define boilerplate required once per component module.
   HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT_MODULE();

   // Define factory object associated with our component of type 'app::server'.
   HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT(app::server, app_server);

   // Define boilerplate code required for each of the component actions. Use the
   // same argument as used for HPX_REGISTER_ACTION_DECLARATION above.
   HPX_REGISTER_ACTION(app::server::print_greeting_action);

The following gives an example of how the component can be used. We create one
instance of the ``app::server`` component on the current :term:`locality` and
invoke the exposed action ``print_greeting_action`` using the global id of the
newly created instance. Note, that no special code is required to delete the
component instance after it is not needed anymore. It will be deleted
automatically when its last reference goes out of scope, here at the closing
brace of the block surrounding the code:

.. code-block:: c++

   // file: $APP_ROOT/use_app_server_example.cpp
   #include <hpx/hpx_init.hpp>
   #include "app_server.hpp"

   int hpx_main()
   {
       {
           // Create an instance of the app_server component on the current locality.
           hpx::naming:id_type app_server_instance =
               hpx::create_component<app::server>(hpx::find_here());

           // Create an instance of the action 'print_greeting_action'.
           app::server::print_greeting_action print_greeting;

           // Invoke the action 'print_greeting' on the newly created component.
           print_greeting(app_server_instance);
       }
       return hpx::finalize();
   }

   int main(int argc, char* argv[])
   {
       return hpx::init(argc, argv);
   }

In order to make sure that the application will be able to use the component
``app::server``, special configuration information must be passed to |hpx|. The
simples way to allow |hpx| to 'find' the component is to provide special ini
configuration files, which add the necessary information to the internal
configuration database. The component should have a special ini file containing
the information specific to the component ``app_server``.

.. code-block:: ini

    # file: $APP_ROOT/app_server.ini
    [hpx.components.app_server]
    name = app_server
    path = $APP_LOCATION/

Here ``$APP_LOCATION`` is the directory where the (binary) component shared
library is located. |hpx| will attempt to load the shared library from there.
The section name ``hpx.components.app_server`` reflects the instance name of the
component (``app_server`` is an arbitrary, but unique name). The property value
for ``hpx.components.app_server.name`` should be the same as used for the second
argument to the macro :c:macro:`HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT` above.

Additionally a file ``.hpx.ini`` which could be located in the current working
directory (see step 3 as described in the section :ref:`loading_ini_files`) can
be used to add to the ini search path for components:

.. code-block:: ini

    # file: $PWD/.hpx.ini
    [hpx]
    ini_path = $[hpx.ini_path]:$APP_ROOT/

This assumes that the above ini file specific to the component is located in
the directory ``$APP_ROOT``.

.. note::

   It is possible to reference the defined property from inside its value. |hpx|
   will gracefully use the previous value of ``hpx.ini_path`` for the reference
   on the right hand side and assign the overall (now expanded) value to the
   property.

.. _logging:

Logging
=======

|hpx| uses a sophisticated logging framework allowing to follow in detail
what operations have been performed inside the |hpx| library in what sequence.
This information proves to be very useful for diagnosing problems or just for
improving the understanding what is happening in |hpx| as a consequence of
invoking |hpx| API functionality.

Default logging
---------------

Enabling default logging is a simple process. The detailed description in the
remainder of this section explains different ways to customize the defaults.
Default logging can be enabled by using one of the following:

* a command line switch :option:`--hpx:debug-hpx-log`, which will enable
  logging to the console terminal
* the command line switch :option:`--hpx:debug-hpx-log`\ ``=<filename>``, which
  enables logging to a given file ``<filename>``, or
* setting an environment variable ``HPX_LOGLEVEL=<loglevel>`` while running the
  |hpx| application. In this case ``<loglevel>`` should be a number between (or
  equal to) ``1`` and ``5`` where ``1`` means minimal logging and ``5`` causes
  to log all available messages. When setting the environment variable the logs
  will be written to a file named ``hpx.<PID>.lo`` in the current working
  directory, where ``<PID>`` is the process id of the console instance of the
  application.

Customizing logging
-------------------

Generally, logging can be customized either using environment variable settings
or using by an ini configuration file. Logging is generated in several
categories, each of which can be customized independently. All customizable
configuration parameters have reasonable defaults, allowing to use logging
without any additional configuration effort. The following table lists the
available categories.

.. list-table:: Logging categories

   * * Category
     * Category shortcut
     * Information to be generated
     * Environment variable
   * * General
     * None
     * Logging information generated by different subsystems of |hpx|, such as
       thread-manager, parcel layer, LCOs, etc.
     * ``HPX_LOGLEVEL``
   * * :term:`AGAS`
     * ``AGAS``
     * Logging output generated by the :term:`AGAS` subsystem
     * ``HPX_AGAS_LOGLEVEL``
   * * Application
     * ``APP``
     * Logging generated by applications.
     * ``HPX_APP_LOGLEVEL``

By default, all logging output is redirected to the console instance of an
application, where it is collected and written to a file, one file for each
logging category.

Each logging category can be customized at two levels, the parameters for each
are stored in the ini configuration sections ``hpx.logging.CATEGORY`` and
``hpx.logging.console.CATEGORY`` (where ``CATEGORY`` is the category shortcut as
listed in the table above). The former influences logging at the source
:term:`locality` and the latter modifies the logging behaviour for each of the
categories at the console instance of an application.

Levels
------

All |hpx| logging output has seven different logging levels. These levels can
be set explicitly or through environmental variables in the main |hpx| ini file
as shown below. The logging levels and their associated integral values are
shown in the table below, ordered from most verbose to least verbose. By
default, all |hpx| logs are set to 0, e.g. all logging output is disabled by
default.

.. table:: Logging levels

   ============= ==============
   Logging level Integral value
   ============= ==============
   ``<debug>``   ``5``
   ``<info>``    ``4``
   ``<warning>`` ``3``
   ``<error>``   ``2``
   ``<fatal>``   ``1``
   No logging    ``0``
   ============= ==============


.. tip::

   The easiest way to enable logging output is to set the environment variable
   corresponding to the logging category to an integral value as described in
   the table above. For instance, setting ``HPX_LOGLEVEL=5`` will enable full
   logging output for the general category. Please note that the syntax and
   means of setting environment variables varies between operating systems.

Configuration
-------------

Logs will be saved to destinations as configured by the user. By default,
logging output is saved on the console instance of an application to
``hpx.<CATEGORY>.<PID>.lo`` (where ``CATEGORY`` and ``PID>`` are placeholders
for the category shortcut and the OS process id). The output for the general
logging category is saved to ``hpx.<PID>.log``. The default settings for the
general logging category are shown here (the syntax is described in the section
:ref:`ini_format`):

.. code-block:: ini

    [hpx.logging]
    level = ${HPX_LOGLEVEL:0}
    destination = ${HPX_LOGDESTINATION:console}
    format = ${HPX_LOGFORMAT:(T%locality%/%hpxthread%.%hpxphase%/%hpxcomponent%) P%parentloc%/%hpxparent%.%hpxparentphase% %time%($hh:$mm.$ss.$mili) [%idx%]|\\n}

The logging level is taken from the environment variable ``HPX_LOGLEVEL`` and
defaults to zero, e.g. no logging. The default logging destination is read from
the environment variable ``HPX_LOGDESTINATION`` On any of the localities it
defaults to ``console`` which redirects all generated logging output to the
console instance of an application. The following table lists the possible
destinations for any logging output. It is possible to specify more than one
destination separated by whitespace.

.. list-table:: Logging destinations

   * * Logging destination
     * Description
   * * file(``<filename>``)
     * Direct all output to a file with the given <filename>.
   * * cout
     * Direct all output to the local standard output of the application
       instance on this :term:`locality`.
   * * cerr
     * Direct all output to the local standard error output of the application
       instance on this :term:`locality`.
   * * console
     * Direct all output to the console instance of the application. The console
       instance has its logging destinations configured separately.
   * * android_log
     * Direct all output to the (Android) system log (available on Android
       systems only).

The logging format is read from the environment variable ``HPX_LOGFORMAT`` and
it defaults to a complex format description. This format consists of several
placeholder fields (for instance ``%locality%`` which will be replaced by
concrete values when the logging output is generated. All other information is
transferred verbatim to the output. The table below describes the available
field placeholders. The separator character ``|`` separates the logging message
prefix formatted as shown and the actual log message which will replace the
separator.

.. list-table:: Available field placeholders

   * * Name
     * Description
   * * :term:`locality`
     * The id of the :term:`locality` on which the logging message was
       generated.
   * * hpxthread
     * The id of the |hpx|-thread generating this logging output.
   * * hpxphase
     * The phase [#]_ of the |hpx|-thread generating this logging output.
   * * hpxcomponent
     * The local virtual address of the component which the current |hpx|-thread
       is accessing.
   * * parentloc
     * The id of the :term:`locality` where the |hpx| thread was running which
       initiated the current |hpx|-thread. The current |hpx|-thread is
       generating this logging output.
   * * hpxparent
     * The id of the |hpx|-thread which initiated the current |hpx|-thread. The
       current |hpx|-thread is generating this logging output.
   * * hpxparentphase
     * The phase of the |hpx|-thread when it initiated the current |hpx|-thread.
       The current |hpx|-thread is generating this logging output.
   * * time
     * The time stamp for this logging outputline as generated by the source
       :term:`locality`.
   * * idx
     * The sequence number of the logging output line as generated on the source
       :term:`locality`.
   * * osthread
     * The sequence number of the OS-thread which executes the current
       |hpx|-thread.

.. note::

   Not all of the field placeholder may be expanded for all generated logging
   output. If no value is available for a particular field it is replaced with a
   sequence of ``'-'`` characters.]

Here is an example line from a logging output generated by one of the |hpx|
examples (please note that this is generated on a single line, without line
break):

.. code-block:: text

   (T00000000/0000000002d46f90.01/00000000009ebc10) P--------/0000000002d46f80.02 17:49.37.320 [000000000000004d]
       <info>  [RT] successfully created component {0000000100ff0001, 0000000000030002} of type: component_barrier[7(3)]

The default settings for the general logging category on the console is shown
here:

.. code-block:: ini

   [hpx.logging.console]
   level = ${HPX_LOGLEVEL:$[hpx.logging.level]}
   destination = ${HPX_CONSOLE_LOGDESTINATION:file(hpx.$[system.pid].log)}
   format = ${HPX_CONSOLE_LOGFORMAT:|}

These settings define how the logging is customized once the logging output is
received by the console instance of an application. The logging level is read
from the environment variable ``HPX_LOGLEVEL`` (as set for the console instance
of the application). The level defaults to the same values as the corresponding
settings in the general logging configuration shown before. The destination on
the console instance is set to be a file which name is generated based from its
OS process id. Setting the environment variable ``HPX_CONSOLE_LOGDESTINATION``
allows customization of the naming scheme for the output file. The logging
format is set to leave the original logging output unchanged, as received from
one of the localities the application runs on.

Command line argument shortcuts
-------------------------------

Additionally, the following shortcuts are available from every |hpx|
application.

.. table:: Predefined command line option shortcuts

   =============== ======================

It is possible to define your own shortcut options. In fact, all of the
shortcuts listed above are pre-defined using the technique described here. Also,
it is possible to redefine any of the pre-defined shortcuts to expand
differently as well.

Shortcut options are obtained from the internal configuration database. They are
stored as key-value properties in a special properties section named
``hpx.commandline``. You can define your own shortcuts by adding the
corresponding definitions to one of the ``ini`` configuration files as described
in the section :ref:`configuration`. For instance, in order to define a command
line shortcut ``--p`` which should expand to ``-hpx:print-counter``, the
following configuration information needs to be added to one of the ``ini``
configuration files:

.. code-block:: ini

   [hpx.commandline.aliases]
   --pc = --hpx:print-counter

.. note::

   Any arguments for shortcut options passed on the command line are retained
   and passed as arguments to the corresponding expanded option. For instance,
   given the definition above, the command line option:

   .. code-block:: bash

      --pc=/threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative

   would be expanded to:

   .. code-block:: bash

      --hpx:print-counter=/threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative

.. important::

   Any shortcut option should either start with a single ``'-'`` or with two
   ``'--'`` characters. Shortcuts starting with a single ``'-'`` are interpreted
   as short options (i.e. everything after the first character following the
   ``'-'`` is treated as the argument). Shortcuts starting with ``'--'`` are
   interpreted as long options. No other shortcut formats are supported.

Specifying options for single localities only
---------------------------------------------

For runs involving more than one :term:`locality` it is sometimes desirable to
supply specific command line options to single localities only. When the |hpx|
application is launched using a scheduler (like PBS, for more details see
section :ref:`unix_pbs`), specifying dedicated command line options for single
localities may be desirable. For this reason all of the command line options
which have the general format ``--hpx:<some_key>`` can be used in a more general
form: ``--hpx:<N>:<some_key>``, where <N> is the number of the :term:`locality`
this command line options will be applied to, all other localities will simply
ignore the option. For instance, the following PBS script passes the option
:option:`--hpx:pu-offset`\ ``=4`` to the :term:`locality` ``'1'`` only.

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   #
   #PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=4

   APP_PATH=~/packages/hpx/bin/hello_world_distributed
   APP_OPTIONS=

   pbsdsh -u $APP_PATH $APP_OPTIONS --hpx:1:pu-offset=4 --hpx:nodes=`cat $PBS_NODEFILE`

.. caution::

   If the first application specific argument (inside ``$APP_OPTIONS`` is a
   non-option (i.e. does not start with a ``-`` or a ``--``, then it must be
   placed before the option :option:`--hpx:nodes`, which, in this case,
   should be the last option on the command line.

   Alternatively, use the option :option:`--hpx:endnodes` to explicitly
   mark the end of the list of node names:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pbsdsh -u $APP_PATH --hpx:1:pu-offset=4 --hpx:nodes=`cat $PBS_NODEFILE` --hpx:endnodes $APP_OPTIONS

More details about |hpx| command line options
---------------------------------------------

This section documents the following list of the command line options in more
detail:

* :ref:`bind`

.. _bind:

The command line option :option:`--hpx:bind`
............................................

This command line option allows one to specify the required affinity of the
|hpx| worker threads to the underlying processing units. As a result the worker
threads will run only on the processing units identified by the corresponding
bind specification. The affinity settings are to be specified using
:option:`--hpx:bind`\ ``=<BINDINGS>``, where ``<BINDINGS>`` have to be formatted as
described below.

In addition to the syntax described below one can use :option:`--hpx:bind`\
``=none`` to disable all binding of any threads to a particular core. This is
mostly supported for debugging purposes.

The specified affinities refer to specific regions within a machine hardware
topology. In order to understand the hardware topology of a particular machine
it may be useful to run the lstopo tool which is part of |hwloc| to see the
reported topology tree. Seeing and understanding a topology tree will definitely
help in understanding the concepts that are discussed below.

Affinities can be specified using HWLOC (|hwloc|) tuples. Tuples of HWLOC
*objects* and associated *indexes* can be specified in the form
``object:index``, ``object:index-index`` or ``object:index,...,index``. HWLOC
objects represent types of mapped items in a topology tree. Possible values for
objects are ``socket``, ``numanode``, ``core`` and ``pu`` (processing unit).
Indexes are non-negative integers that specify a unique physical object in a
topology tree using its logical sequence number.

Chaining multiple tuples together in the more general form
``object1:index1[.object2:index2[...]]`` is permissible. While the first tuple's
object may appear anywhere in the topology, the Nth tuple's object must have a
shallower topology depth than the (N+1)th tuple's object. Put simply: as you
move right in a tuple chain, objects must go deeper in the topology tree.
Indexes specified in chained tuples are relative to the scope of the parent
object. For example, ``socket:0.core:1`` refers to the second core in the first
socket (all indices are zero based).

Multiple affinities can be specified using several :option:`--hpx:bind` command
line options or by appending several affinities separated by a ``';'`` By
default, if multiple affinities are specified, they are added.

.. If prefixed with``"~"`` the given affinity will be cleared instead of added
   to the current list of locations. If prefixed with``"x"`` the given location
   will be and'ed instead of added to the current list. If prefixed with ``"^"``
   the given location will be xor'ed.

``"all"`` is a special affinity consisting in the entire current topology.

.. note::

   All 'names' in an affinity specification, such as ``thread``, ``socket``,
   ``numanode``, ``pu`` or ``all`` can be abbreviated. Thus the affinity
   specification ``threads:0-3=socket:0.core:1.pu:1`` is fully equivalent to its
   shortened form ``t:0-3=s:0.c:1.p:1``.

Here is a full grammar describing the possible format of mappings:

.. productionlist::
   mappings: `distribution` | `mapping` (";" `mapping`)*
   distribution: "compact" | "scatter" | "balanced" | "numa-balanced"
   mapping: `thread_spec` "=" `pu_specs`
   thread_spec: "thread:" `range_specs`
   pu_specs: `pu_spec` ("." `pu_spec`)*
   pu_spec: `type` ":" `range_specs` | "~" `pu_spec`
   range_specs: `range_spec` ("," `range_spec`)*
   range_spec: int | int "-" int | "all"
   type: "socket" | "numanode" | "core" | "pu"

The following example assumes a system with at least 4 cores, where each core
has more than 1 processing unit (hardware threads). Running
``hello_world_distributed`` with 4 OS-threads (on 4 processing units), where
each of those threads is bound to the first processing unit of each of the
cores, can be achieved by invoking:

.. code-block:: bash

   hello_world_distributed -t4 --hpx:bind=thread:0-3=core:0-3.pu:0

Here ``thread:0-3`` specifies the OS threads for which to define affinity
bindings, and ``core:0-3.pu:`` defines that for each of the cores (``core:0-3``)
only their first processing unit ``pu:0`` should be used.

.. note::

   The command line option :option:`--hpx:print-bind` can be used to print the
   bitmasks generated from the affinity mappings as specified with
   :option:`--hpx:bind`. For instance, on a system with hyperthreading enabled
   (i.e. 2 processing units per core), the command line:

   .. code-block:: bash

      hello_world_distributed -t4 --hpx:bind=thread:0-3=core:0-3.pu:0 --hpx:print-bind

   will cause this output to be printed:

   .. code-block:: text

      0: PU L#0(P#0), Core L#0, Socket L#0, Node L#0(P#0)
      1: PU L#2(P#2), Core L#1, Socket L#0, Node L#0(P#0)
      2: PU L#4(P#4), Core L#2, Socket L#0, Node L#0(P#0)
      3: PU L#6(P#6), Core L#3, Socket L#0, Node L#0(P#0)

   where each bit in the bitmasks corresponds to a processing unit the listed
   worker thread will be bound to run on.

The difference between the four possible predefined distribution schemes
(``compact``, ``scatter``, ``balanced`` and ``numa-balanced``) is best explained
with an example. Imagine that we have a system with 4 cores and 4 hardware
threads per core on 2 sockets. If we place 8 threads the assignments produced by
the ``compact``, ``scatter``, ``balanced`` and ``numa-balanced`` types are shown
in the figure below. Notice that ``compact`` does not fully utilize all the
cores in the system. For this reason it is recommended that applications are run
using the ``scatter`` or ``balanced``/``numa-balanced`` options in most cases.

   Schematic of thread affinity type distributions.

In addition to the predefined distributions it is possible to restrict the
resources used by |hpx| to the process CPU mask. The CPU mask is typically set
by e.g. |mpi|_ and batch environments. Using the command line option
:option:`--hpx:use-process-mask` makes |hpx| act as if only the processing units
in the CPU mask are available for use by |hpx|. The number of threads is
automatically determined from the CPU mask. The number of threads can still be
changed manually using this option, but only to a number less than or equal to
the number of processing units in the CPU mask. The option
:option:`--hpx:print-bind` is useful in conjunction with
:option:`--hpx:use-process-mask` to make sure threads are placed as expected.
