Software and libraries

The table below presents all the necessary prerequisites for building |hpx|.

.. table:: Software prerequisites for |hpx|

   ====================== =================== ================== ==================
   \                      Name                Minimum Version    Latest tested
   ====================== =================== ================== ==================
   **Build System**       |cmake|_            3.20               4.0
   **Required Libraries** |boost|_            1.71.0             1.88.0
   \                      |hwloc|_            1.5                2.4
   ====================== =================== ================== ==================

The most important dependencies are |boost|_ and |hwloc|_. The installation of Boost
is described in detail in Boost's `Getting Started <https://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/index.html>`_
document. A recent version of hwloc is required in order to support thread
pinning and NUMA awareness and can be found in |hwloc_downloads|_.

|hpx| is written in 99.99% Standard C++ (the remaining 0.01% is platform
specific assembly code). As such, |hpx| is compilable with almost any standards
compliant C++ compiler. The code base takes advantage of C++ language and
standard library features when available.

.. note::

   When building Boost using gcc, please note that it is required to specify a
   ``cxxflags=-std=c++20`` command line argument to ``b2`` (``bjam``).

.. note::

   In most configurations, |hpx| depends only on header-only Boost.
   Boost.Filesystem is required if the standard library does not support
   filesystem. The following are not needed by default, but are required in
   certain configurations: Boost.Chrono, Boost.DateTime, Boost.Log,
   Boost.LogSetup, Boost.Regex, and Boost.Thread.

Depending on the options you chose while building and installing |hpx|,
you will find that |hpx| may depend on several other libraries such as those
listed below.

.. note::

   In order to use a high speed parcelport, we currently recommend configuring
   |hpx| to use MPI so that MPI can be used for communication between different
   localities. Please set the CMake variable ``MPI_CXX_COMPILER`` to your MPI
   C++ compiler wrapper if not detected automatically.
