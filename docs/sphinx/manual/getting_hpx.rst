=============
Getting |hpx|
=============

There are |hpx| packages available for a few Linux distributions. The easiest
way to get started with |hpx| is to use those packages. We keep an up-to-date
list with instructions on the |stellar_hpx_download|_ page. If you use one of
the available packages you can skip the next section, :ref:`hpx_build_system`,
but we still recommend that you look through it as it contains useful
information on how you can customize |hpx| at compile-time.

If there isn't a package available for your platform you should either clone our
repository:

.. code-block: bash

   git clone https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx.git

or download a package with the source files from |stellar_hpx_download|_.
