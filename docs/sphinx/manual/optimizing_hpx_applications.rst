=============================
Optimizing |hpx| applications
=============================

.. _performance_counters:

Performance counters
====================

Performance counters in |hpx| are used to provide information as to how well the
runtime system or an application is performing. The counter data can help
determine system bottlenecks, and fine-tune system and application performance.
The |hpx| runtime system, its networking, and other layers provide counter data
that an application can consume to provide users with information about how
well the application is performing.

Applications can also use counter data to determine how much system resources to
consume. For example, an application that transfers data over the network could
consume counter data from a network switch to determine how much data to
transfer without competing for network bandwidth with other network traffic. The
application could use the counter data to adjust its transfer rate as the
bandwidth usage from other network traffic increases or decreases.

Performance counters are |hpx| parallel processes that expose a predefined
interface. |hpx| exposes special API functions that allow one to create, manage,
and read the counter data, and release instances of performance counters.
Performance Counter instances are accessed by name, and these names have a
predefined structure which is described in the section
:ref:`performance_counter_names`. The advantage of this is that any Performance
Counter can be accessed remotely (from a different :term:`locality`) or locally
(from the same :term:`locality`). Moreover, since all counters expose their data
using the same API, any code consuming counter data can be utilized to access
arbitrary system information with minimal effort.

Counter data may be accessed in real time. More information about how to consume
counter data can be found in the section :ref:`consuming`.

All |hpx| applications provide command line options related to performance
counters, such as the ability to list available counter types, or periodically
query specific counters to be printed to the screen or save them in a file. For
more information, please refer to the section :ref:`commandline`.

.. _performance_counter_names:

Performance counter names
-------------------------

All Performance Counter instances have a name uniquely identifying each
instance. This name can be used to access the counter, retrieve all related meta
data, and to query the counter data (as described in the section
:ref:`consuming`). Counter names are strings with a predefined structure. The
general form of a countername is:

.. code-block:: text

   /objectname{full_instancename}/countername@parameters

where ``full_instancename`` could be either another (full) counter name or a
string formatted as:

.. code-block:: text

   parentinstancename#parentindex/instancename#instanceindex

Each separate part of a countername (e.g., ``objectname``, ``countername``
``parentinstancename``, ``instancename``, and ``parameters``) should start with
a letter (``'a'``\ ...\ ``'z'``, ``'A'``\ ...\ ``'Z'``) or an underscore
character (``'_'``), optionally followed by letters, digits (``'0'``\ ...\
``'9'``), hyphen (``'-'``), or underscore characters. Whitespace is not allowed
inside a counter name. The characters ``'/'``, ``'{'``, ``'}'``, ``'#'`` and
``'@'`` have a special meaning and are used to delimit the different parts of
the counter name.

The parts ``parentinstanceindex`` and ``instanceindex`` are integers. If an
index is not specified, |hpx| will assume a default of ``-1``.

.. _example:

Two counter name examples
-------------------------

This section gives examples of both simple counter names and aggregate
counter names. For more information on simple and aggregate counter
names, please see :ref:`performance_counter_instances`.

An example of a well-formed (and meaningful) simple counter name would be:

.. code-block:: text

   /threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative

This counter returns the current cumulative number of executed (retired)
|hpx| threads for the :term:`locality` ``0``. The counter type of this counter
is ``/threads/count/cumulative`` and the full instance name is
``locality#0/total``. This counter type does not require an ``instanceindex`` or
``parameters`` to be specified.

In this case, the ``parentindex`` (the ``'0'``) designates the :term:`locality`
for which the counter instance is created. The counter will return the number of
|hpx| threads retired on that particular :term:`locality`.

Another example for a well formed (aggregate) counter name is:

.. code-block:: text

   /statistics{/threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative}/average@500

This counter takes the simple counter from the first example, samples its values
every ``500`` milliseconds, and returns the average of the value samples
whenever it is queried. The counter type of this counter is
``/statistics/average`` and the instance name is the full name of the counter
for which the values have to be averaged. In this case, the ``parameters`` (the
``'500'``) specify the sampling interval for the averaging to take place (in
milliseconds).

.. _types:

Performance counter types
-------------------------

Every performance counter belongs to a specific performance counter type which
classifies the counters into groups of common semantics. The type of a counter
is identified by the ``objectname`` and the ``countername`` parts of the name.

.. code-block:: text

   /objectname/countername

When an application starts |hpx| will register all available counter types on each of
the localities. These counter types are held in a special performance counter
registration database, which can be used to retrieve the meta data related
to a counter type and to create counter instances based on a given counter
instance name.

.. _performance_counter_instances:

Performance counter instances
-----------------------------

The ``full_instancename`` distinguishes different counter instances of the same
counter type. The formatting of the ``full_instancename`` depends on the counter
type. There are two types of counters: simple counters, which usually generate
the counter values based on direct measurements, and aggregate counters, which
take another counter and transform its values before generating their own
counter values. An example for a simple counter is given :ref:`above <example>`:
counting retired |hpx| threads. An aggregate counter is shown as an example
:ref:`above <example>` as well: calculating the average of the underlying
counter values sampled at constant time intervals.

While simple counters use instance names formatted as
``parentinstancename#parentindex/instancename#instanceindex``, most aggregate
counters have the full counter name of the embedded counter as their instance
name.

Not all simple counter types require specifying all four elements of a full counter
instance name; some of the parts (``parentinstancename``, ``parentindex``,
``instancename``, and ``instanceindex``) are optional for specific counters.
Please refer to the documentation of a particular counter for more information
about the formatting requirements for the name of this counter (see
:ref:`counters`).

The ``parameters`` are used to pass additional information to a counter at
creation time. They are optional, and they fully depend on the concrete counter.
Even if a specific counter type allows additional parameters to be given, those
usually are not required as sensible defaults will be chosen. Please refer to
the documentation of a particular counter for more information about what
parameters are supported, how to specify them, and what default values are
assumed (see also :ref:`counters`).

Every :term:`locality` of an application exposes its own set of performance
counter types and performance counter instances. The set of exposed counters is
determined dynamically at application start based on the execution environment
of the application. For instance, this set is influenced by the current hardware
environment for the :term:`locality` (such as whether the :term:`locality` has
access to accelerators), and the software environment of the application (such
as the number of OS threads used to execute |hpx| threads).

.. _wildcards:

Using wildcards in performance counter names
--------------------------------------------

It is possible to use wildcard characters when specifying performance counter
names. Performance counter names can contain two types of wildcard characters:

* Wildcard characters in the performance counter type
* Wildcard characters in the performance counter instance name

A wildcard character has a meaning which is very close to usual file name
wildcard matching rules implemented by common shells (like bash).

.. list-table:: Wildcard characters in the performance counter type

   * * Wildcard
     * Description
   * * ``*``
     * This wildcard character matches any number (zero or more) of arbitrary
       characters.
   * * ``?``
     * This wildcard character matches any single arbitrary character.
   * * ``[...]``
     * This wildcard character matches any single character from the list of
       specified within the square brackets.

.. list-table:: Wildcard characters in the performance counter instance name

   * * Wildcard
     * Description
   * * ``*``
     * This wildcard character matches any :term:`locality` or any thread,
       depending on whether it is used for ``locality#*`` or
       ``worker-thread#*``. No other wildcards are allowed in counter instance
       names.

.. _consuming:

Consuming performance counter data
----------------------------------

You can consume performance data using either the command line interface,
the |hpx| application or the |hpx| API. The command line interface is easier to
use, but it is less flexible and does not allow one to adjust the behaviour of
your application at runtime. The command line interface provides a convenience
abstraction but simplified abstraction for querying and logging performance
counter data for a set of performance counters.

.. _performance_counters_commandline:

Consuming performance counter data from the command line
--------------------------------------------------------

|hpx| provides a set of predefined command line options for every application
that uses ``hpx::init`` for its initialization. While there are many more
command line options available (see :ref:`commandline`), the set of options related
to performance counters allows one to list existing counters, and query existing
counters once at application termination or repeatedly after a constant time
interval.

The following table summarizes the available command line options:

.. list-table:: |hpx| Command Line Options Related to Performance Counters

   * * Command line option
     * Description
   * * ``--hpx:print-counter``
     * Prints the specified performance counter either repeatedly and/or at the
       times specified by ``--hpx:print-counter-at`` (see also option
       ``--hpx:print-counter-interval``).
   * * ``--hpx:print-counter-reset``
     * Prints the specified performance counter either repeatedly and/or at the
       times specified by ``--hpx:print-counter-at``. Reset the counter after the
       value is queried (see also option ``--hpx:print-counter-interval``).
   * * ``--hpx:print-counter-interval``
     * Prints the performance counter(s) specified with ``--hpx:print-counter``
       repeatedly after the time interval (specified in milliseconds)
       (default:``0`` which means print once at shutdown).
   * * ``--hpx:print-counter-destination``
     * Prints the performance counter(s) specified with ``--hpx:print-counter``
       to the given file (default: console).
   * * ``--hpx:list-counters``
     * Lists the names of all registered performance counters.
   * * ``--hpx:list-counter-infos``
     * Lists the description of all registered performance counters.
   * * ``--hpx:print-counter-format``
     * Prints the performance counter(s) specified with ``--hpx:print-counter``.
       Possible formats in CVS format with header or without any header (see
       option ``--hpx:no-csv-header``), possible values: ``csv`` (prints counter
       values in CSV format with full names as header) ``csv-short`` (prints
       counter values in CSV format with shortnames provided with
       ``--hpx:print-counter`` as ``--hpx:print-counter
       shortname,full-countername``).
   * * ``--hpx:no-csv-header``
     * Prints the performance counter(s) specified with ``--hpx:print-counter``
       and ``csv`` or ``csv-short`` format specified with
       ``--hpx:print-counter-format`` without header.
   * * ``--hpx:print-counter-at arg``
     * Prints the performance counter(s) specified with ``--hpx:print-counter``
       (or ``--hpx:print-counter-reset``) at the given point in time. Possible
       argument values: ``startup``, ``shutdown`` (default), ``noshutdown``.
   * * ``--hpx:reset-counters``
     * Resets all performance counter(s) specified with ``--hpx:print-counter``
       after they have been evaluated.
   * * ``--hpx:print-counter-types``
     * Appends counter type description to generated output.
   * * ``--hpx:print-counters-locally``
     * Each locality prints only its own local counters.

While the options ``--hpx:list-counters`` and ``--hpx:list-counter-infos`` give
a short list of all available counters, the full documentation for those can
be found in the section :ref:`counters`.

A simple example
----------------

All of the commandline options mentioned above can be tested using
the ``hello_world_distributed`` example.

Listing all available counters ``hello_world_distributed --hpx:list-counters``
yields:

.. code-block:: text

   List of available counter instances (replace * below with the appropriate
   sequence number)
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   /agas/count/allocate /agas/count/bind /agas/count/bind_gid
   /agas/count/bind_name ... /threads{locality#*/allocator#*}/count/objects
   /threads{locality#*/total}/count/stack-recycles
   /threads{locality#*/total}/idle-rate
   /threads{locality#*/worker-thread#*}/idle-rate

Providing more information about all available counters,
``hello_world_distributed --hpx:list-counter-infos`` yields:

.. code-block:: text

   Information about available counter instances (replace * below with the
   appropriate sequence number)
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   fullname: /agas/count/allocate helptext: returns the number of invocations of
   the AGAS service 'allocate' type: counter_type::raw version: 1.0.0
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   fullname: /agas/count/bind helptext: returns the number of invocations of the
   AGAS service 'bind' type: counter_type::raw version: 1.0.0
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   fullname: /agas/count/bind_gid helptext: returns the number of invocations of
   the AGAS service 'bind_gid' type: counter_type::raw version: 1.0.0
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   ...

This command will not only list the counter names but also a short description
of the data exposed by this counter.

.. note::

   The list of available counters may differ depending on the concrete execution
   environment (hardware or software) of your application.

Requesting the counter data for one or more performance counters can be achieved
by invoking ``hello_world_distributed`` with a list of counter names:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ hello_world_distributed \
       --hpx:print-counter=/threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative \
       --hpx:print-counter=/agas{locality#0/total}/count/bind

which yields for instance:

.. code-block:: bash

   hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
   /threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative,1,0.212527,[s],33
   /agas{locality#0/total}/count/bind,1,0.212790,[s],11

The first line is the normal output generated by ``hello_world_distributed`` and
has no relation to the counter data listed. The last two lines contain the
counter data as gathered at application shutdown. These lines have six fields, the
counter name, the sequence number of the counter invocation, the time stamp at
which this information has been sampled, the unit of measure for the time stamp,
the actual counter value and an optional unit of measure for the counter value.

.. note::

   The command line option ``--hpx:print-counter-types`` will append a seventh
   field to the generated output. This field will hold an abbreviated counter
   type.

The actual counter value can be represented by a single number (for counters
returning singular values) or a list of numbers separated by ``':'`` (for
counters returning an array of values, like for instance a histogram).

.. note::

   The name of the performance counter will be enclosed in double quotes ``'"'``
   if it contains one or more commas ``','``.

Requesting to query the counter data once after a constant time interval with
this command line:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ hello_world_distributed \
       --hpx:print-counter=/threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative \
       --hpx:print-counter=/agas{locality#0/total}/count/bind \
       --hpx:print-counter-interval=20

yields for instance (leaving off the actual console output of the
``hello_world_distributed`` example for brevity):

.. code-block:: text

   threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative,1,0.002409,[s],22
   agas{locality#0/total}/count/bind,1,0.002542,[s],9
   threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative,2,0.023002,[s],41
   agas{locality#0/total}/count/bind,2,0.023557,[s],10
   threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative,3,0.037514,[s],46
   agas{locality#0/total}/count/bind,3,0.038679,[s],10

The command ``--hpx:print-counter-destination=<file>`` will redirect all counter
data gathered to the specified file name, which avoids cluttering the console
output of your application.

The command line option ``--hpx:print-counter`` supports using a limited set of
wildcards for a (very limited) set of use cases. In particular, all occurrences
of ``#*`` as in ``locality#*`` and in ``worker-thread#*`` will be automatically
expanded to the proper set of performance counter names representing the actual
environment for the executed program. For instance, if your program is utilizing
four worker threads for the execution of |hpx| threads (see command line option
:option:`--hpx:threads`) the following command line

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ hello_world_distributed \
       --hpx:threads=4 \
       --hpx:print-counter=/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative

will print the value of the performance counters monitoring each of the worker
threads:

.. code-block:: text

   hello world from OS-thread 1 on locality 0
   hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
   hello world from OS-thread 3 on locality 0
   hello world from OS-thread 2 on locality 0
   /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#0}/count/cumulative,1,0.0025214,[s],27
   /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#1}/count/cumulative,1,0.0025453,[s],33
   /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#2}/count/cumulative,1,0.0025683,[s],29
   /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#3}/count/cumulative,1,0.0025904,[s],33

The command ``--hpx:print-counter-format`` takes values ``csv`` and
``csv-short`` to generate CSV formatted counter values with a header.

With format as csv:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ hello_world_distributed \
       --hpx:threads=2 \
       --hpx:print-counter-format csv \
       --hpx:print-counter /threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative \
       --hpx:print-counter /threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative-phases

will print the values of performance counters in CSV format with the full
countername as a header:

.. code-block:: text

   hello world from OS-thread 1 on locality 0
   hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
   /threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative,/threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative-phases
   39,93

With format csv-short:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ hello_world_distributed \
       --hpx:threads 2 \
       --hpx:print-counter-format csv-short \
       --hpx:print-counter cumulative,/threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative \
       --hpx:print-counter phases,/threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative-phases

will print the values of performance counters in CSV format with the short countername
as a header:

.. code-block:: text

   hello world from OS-thread 1 on locality 0
   hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
   cumulative,phases
   39,93

With format csv and csv-short when used with ``--hpx:print-counter-interval``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ hello_world_distributed \
       --hpx:threads 2 \
       --hpx:print-counter-format csv-short \
       --hpx:print-counter cumulative,/threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative \
       --hpx:print-counter phases,/threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative-phases \
       --hpx:print-counter-interval 5

will print the header only once repeating the performance counter value(s) repeatedly:

.. code-block:: text

   cum,phases
   25,42
   hello world from OS-thread 1 on locality 0
   hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
   44,95

The command ``--hpx:no-csv-header`` can be used with
``--hpx:print-counter-format`` to print performance counter values in CSV format
without any header:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ hello_world_distributed \
   --hpx:threads 2 \
   --hpx:print-counter-format csv-short \
   --hpx:print-counter cumulative,/threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative \
   --hpx:print-counter phases,/threads{locality#*/total}/count/cumulative-phases \
   --hpx:no-csv-header

will print:

.. code-block:: text

   hello world from OS-thread 1 on locality 0
   hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
   37,91

.. _api:

Consuming performance counter data using the |hpx| API
------------------------------------------------------

|hpx| provides an API that allows users to discover performance counters and
to retrieve the current value of any existing performance counter from any application.

Discover existing performance counters
--------------------------------------

Retrieve the current value of any performance counter
-----------------------------------------------------

Performance counters are specialized |hpx| components. In order to retrieve a
counter value, the performance counter needs to be instantiated. |hpx| exposes a
client component object for this purpose::

    hpx::performance_counters::performance_counter counter(std::string const& name);

Instantiating an instance of this type will create the performance counter
identified by the given ``name``. Only the first invocation for any given counter
name will create a new instance of that counter. All following invocations for a
given counter name will reference the initially created instance. This ensures
that at any point in time there is never more than one active instance of
any of the existing performance counters.

In order to access the counter value (or to invoke any of the other functionality
related to a performance counter, like ``start``, ``stop`` or ``reset``) member
functions of the created client component instance should be called::

    // print the current number of threads created on locality 0
    hpx::performance_counters::performance_counter count(
        "/threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative");
    hpx::cout << count.get_value<int>().get() << std::endl;

For more information about the client component type, see
:cpp:class:`hpx::performance_counters::performance_counter`

.. note::

   In the above example ``count.get_value()`` returns a future. In order to print
   the result we must append ``.get()`` to retrieve the value. You could write the
   above example like this for more clarity::

       // print the current number of threads created on locality 0
       hpx::performance_counters::performance_counter count(
           "/threads{locality#0/total}/count/cumulative");
       hpx::future<int> result = count.get_value<int>();
       hpx::cout << result.get() << std::endl;

.. _providing:

Providing performance counter data
----------------------------------

|hpx| offers several ways by which you may provide your own data as a
performance counter. This has the benefit of exposing additional, possibly
application-specific information using the existing Performance Counter
framework, unifying the process of gathering data about your application.

An application that wants to provide counter data can implement a performance
counter to provide the data. When a consumer queries performance data, the |hpx|
runtime system calls the provider to collect the data. The runtime system uses
an internal registry to determine which provider to call.

Generally, there are two ways of exposing your own performance counter data: a
simple, function-based way and a more complex, but more powerful way of
implementing a full performance counter. Both alternatives are described in the
following sections.

.. _simple_counters:

Exposing performance counter data using a simple function
---------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to expose arbitrary numeric data is to write a function which
will then be called whenever a consumer queries this counter. Currently, this
type of performance counter can only be used to expose integer values. The
expected signature of this function is::

    std::int64_t some_performance_data(bool reset);

The argument ``bool reset`` (which is supplied by the runtime system when the
function is invoked) specifies whether the counter value should be reset after
evaluating the current value (if applicable).

For instance, here is such a function returning how often it was invoked::

    // The atomic variable 'counter' ensures the thread safety of the counter.
    boost::atomic<std::int64_t> counter(0);

    std::int64_t some_performance_data(bool reset)
    {
        std::int64_t result = ++counter;
        if (reset)
            counter = 0;
        return result;
    }

This example function exposes a linearly-increasing value as our performance
data. The value is incremented on each invocation, i.e., each time a consumer
requests the counter data of this performance counter.

The next step in exposing this counter to the runtime system is to register the
function as a new raw counter type using the |hpx| API function
:cpp:func:`hpx::performance_counters::install_counter_type`. A counter type
represents certain common characteristics of counters, like their counter type
name and any associated description information. The following snippet shows an
example of how to register the function ``some_performance_data``, which is shown
above, for a counter type named ``"/test/data"``. This registration has to be
executed before any consumer instantiates, and queries an instance of this
counter type::

    #include <hpx/include/performance_counters.hpp>

    void register_counter_type()
    {
        // Call the HPX API function to register the counter type.
        hpx::performance_counters::install_counter_type(
            "/test/data",                                   // counter type name
            &some_performance_data,                         // function providing counter data
            "returns a linearly increasing counter value"   // description text (optional)
            ""                                              // unit of measure (optional)
        );
    }

Now it is possible to instantiate a new counter instance based on the naming
scheme ``"/test{locality#*/total}/data"`` where ``*`` is a zero-based integer
index identifying the :term:`locality` for which the counter instance should be
accessed. The function
:cpp:func:`hpx::performance_counters::install_counter_type` enables users to
instantiate exactly one counter instance for each :term:`locality`. Repeated
requests to instantiate such a counter will return the same instance, i.e., the
instance created for the first request.

If this counter needs to be accessed using the standard |hpx| command line
options, the registration has to be performed during application startup, before
``hpx_main`` is executed. The best way to achieve this is to register an |hpx|
startup function using the API function
:cpp:func:`hpx::register_startup_function` before calling ``hpx::init`` to
initialize the runtime system::

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {

.. _full_counters:

Implementing a full performance counter
---------------------------------------

Sometimes, the simple way of exposing a single value as a performance counter is
not sufficient. For that reason, |hpx| provides a means of implementing full
performance counters which support:

* Retrieving the descriptive information about the performance counter
* Retrieving the current counter value
* Resetting the performance counter (value)
* Starting the performance counter
* Stopping the performance counter
* Setting the (initial) value of the performance counter

Every full performance counter will implement a predefined interface:

.. literalinclude:: ../../libs/full/performance_counters/include/hpx/performance_counters/performance_counter.hpp
   :language: c++

In order to implement a full performance counter, you have to create an |hpx|
component exposing this interface. To simplify this task, |hpx| provides a
ready-made base class which handles all the boiler plate of creating
a component for you. The remainder of this section will explain the process of creating a full
performance counter based on the Sine example, which you can find in the
directory ``examples/performance_counters/sine/``.

The base class is defined in the header file :download:`base_performance_counter.cpp <../../libs/full/performance_counters/include/hpx/performance_counters/base_performance_counter.hpp>`
as:

.. literalinclude:: ../../libs/full/performance_counters/include/hpx/performance_counters/base_performance_counter.hpp
   :language: c++

The single template parameter is expected to receive the type of the
derived class implementing the performance counter. In the Sine example
this looks like:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/performance_counters/sine/server/sine.hpp
   :language: c++

i.e., the type ``sine_counter`` is derived from the base class passing the type
as a template argument (please see :download:`simplest_performance_counter.cpp <../../examples/performance_counters/simplest_performance_counter.cpp>`
for the full source code of the counter definition). For more information about this
technique (called Curiously Recurring Template Pattern - CRTP), please see for
instance the corresponding `Wikipedia article
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern>`_. This base
class itself is derived from the ``performance_counter`` interface described
above.

Additionally, a full performance counter implementation not only exposes the
actual value but also provides information about:

* The point in time a particular value was retrieved.
* A (sequential) invocation count.
* The actual counter value.
* An optional scaling coefficient.
* Information about the counter status.

.. _counters:

Existing |hpx| performance counters
-----------------------------------

The |hpx| runtime system exposes a wide variety of predefined performance
counters. These counters expose critical information about different modules of
the runtime system. They can help determine system bottlenecks and fine-tune
system and application performance.

       ``<papi_event>`` is the name of the PAPI event to expose as a performance
       counter (such as ``PAPI_SR_INS``). Note that the list of available PAPI
       events changes depending on the used architecture.

       For a full list of available PAPI events and their (short) description
       use the ``--hpx:list-counters`` and ``--hpx:papi-event-info=all`` command
       line options.
   * * Counter instance formatting
     * ``locality#*/total`` or

       ``locality#*/worker-thread#*``

       where:

       ``locality#*`` is defining the :term:`locality` for which the current
       current accumulated value of all busy-loop counters of all worker threads
       should be queried. The :term:`locality` id (given by ``*``) is a (zero
       based) number identifying the :term:`locality`.

       ``worker-thread#*`` is defining the worker thread for which the current
       value of the busy-loop counter should be queried for. The worker thread
       number (given by the ``*``) is a (zero based) worker thread number (given
       by the ``*``) is a (zero based) number identifying the worker thread. The
       number of available worker threads is usually specified on the command
       line for the application using the option :option:`--hpx:threads`.

.. note::

   The ``/arithmetics`` counters can consume an arbitrary number of other
   counters. For this reason those have to be specified as parameters (a comma
   separated list of counters appended after a ``'@'``). For instance:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      $ ./bin/hello_world_distributed -t2 \
          --hpx:print-counter=/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative \
          --hpx:print-counter=/arithmetics/add@/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative
      hello world from OS-thread 0 on locality 0
      hello world from OS-thread 1 on locality 0
      /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#0}/count/cumulative,1,0.515640,[s],25
      /threads{locality#0/worker-thread#1}/count/cumulative,1,0.515520,[s],36
      /arithmetics/add@/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative,1,0.516445,[s],64

   Since all wildcards in the parameters are expanded, this example is fully
   equivalent to specifying both counters separately to ``/arithmetics/add``:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      $ ./bin/hello_world_distributed -t2 \
          --hpx:print-counter=/threads{locality#0/worker-thread#*}/count/cumulative \
          --hpx:print-counter=/arithmetics/add@\

   * * Description
     * Returns a histogram representing the times between arriving parcels for
       the action which is given by the counter parameter.

       This counter returns an array of values, where the first three values
       represent the three parameters used for the histogram followed by one
       value for each of the histogram buckets.

       The first unit of measure displayed for this counter ``[ns]`` refers to
       the lower and upper boundary values in the returned histogram data only.
       The second unit of measure displayed ``[0.1%]`` refers to the actual
       histogram data.

       For each bucket the counter shows a value between ``0`` and ``1000``
       which corresponds to a percentage value between ``0%`` and ``100%``.
   * * Parameters
     * The action type and optional histogram parameters. The action type is
       the string which has been used while registering the action with |hpx|,
       e.g. which has been passed as the second parameter to the macro
       :c:macro:`HPX_REGISTER_ACTION` or :c:macro:`HPX_REGISTER_ACTION_ID`.

       The action type may be followed by a comma separated list of up-to three
       numbers: the lower and upper boundaries for the collected histogram, and
       the number of buckets for the histogram to generate. By default these
       three numbers will be assumed to be ``0`` (``[ns]``, lower
       bound), ``1000000`` (``[ns]``, upper bound), and ``20`` (number of
       buckets to generate).

.. note::

   The performance counters related to :term:`parcel` coalescing are available only if
   the configuration time constant ``HPX_WITH_PARCEL_COALESCING`` is set to
   ``ON`` (default: ``ON``). However, even in this case it will be available
   only for actions that are enabled for parcel coalescing (see the
   macros :c:macro:`HPX_ACTION_USES_MESSAGE_COALESCING` and
   :c:macro:`HPX_ACTION_USES_MESSAGE_COALESCING_NOTHROW`).

.. [#] A message can potentially consist of more than one :term:`parcel`.

APEX integration
================

|hpx| provides integration with |apex|_, which is a framework for application
profiling using task timers and various performance counters :footcite:t:`2015:apex`.
It can be added as a ``git`` submodule by turning on the option :option:`HPX_WITH_APEX:BOOL`
during |cmake| configuration. |tau|_ is an optional dependency when using |apex|.

To build |hpx| with |apex|, add :option:`HPX_WITH_APEX`\ ``=ON``, and,
optionally, ``Tau_ROOT=$PATH_TO_TAU`` to your |cmake| configuration. In
addition, you can override the tag used for |apex| with the
:option:`HPX_WITH_APEX_TAG` option. Please see the |apex_hpx_doc|_ for detailed
instructions on using |apex| with |hpx|.
