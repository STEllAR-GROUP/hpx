/*
 * Based on "Spinlocks and Read-Write Locks" by Dr. Steven Fuerst:
 *      http://locklessinc.com/articles/locks/
 *
 * Dr. Fuerst further credits:
 *      There exists a form of the ticket lock that is designed for read-write
 * locks. An example written in assembly was posted to the Linux kernel mailing
 * list in 2002 by David Howells from RedHat. This was a highly optimized
 * version of a read-write ticket lock developed at IBM in the early 90's by
 * Joseph Seigh. Note that a similar (but not identical) algorithm was published
 * by John Mellor-Crummey and Michael Scott in their landmark paper "Scalable
 * Reader-Writer Synchronization for Shared-Memory Multiprocessors".
 *
 * The following is an explanation of this code. First, the underlying lock
 * structure.
 *
 *      struct {
 *              uint16_t writers;       Now serving for writers
 *              uint16_t readers;       Now serving for readers
 *              uint16_t next;          Next available ticket number
 *              uint16_t __notused;     Padding
 *      }
 *
 * First, imagine a store's 'take a number' ticket algorithm. A customer takes
 * a unique ticket number and customers are served in ticket order. In the data
 * structure, 'writers' is the next writer to be served, 'readers' is the next
 * reader to be served, and 'next' is the next available ticket number.
 *
 * Next, consider exclusive (write) locks. The 'now serving' number for writers
 * is 'writers'. To lock, 'take a number' and wait until that number is being
 * served; more specifically, atomically copy and increment the current value of
 * 'next', and then wait until 'writers' equals that copied number.
 *
 * Shared (read) locks are similar. Like writers, readers atomically get the
 * next number available. However, instead of waiting for 'writers' to equal
 * their number, they wait for 'readers' to equal their number.
 *
 * This has the effect of queuing lock requests in the order they arrive
 * (incidentally avoiding starvation).
 *
 * Each lock/unlock pair requires incrementing both 'readers' and 'writers'.
 * In the case of a reader, the 'readers' increment happens when the reader
 * acquires the lock (to allow read-lock sharing), and the 'writers' increment
 * happens when the reader releases the lock. In the case of a writer, both
 * 'readers' and 'writers' are incremented when the writer releases the lock.
 *
 * For example, consider the following read (R) and write (W) lock requests:
 *
 *                                              writers readers next
 *                                              0       0       0
 *      R: ticket 0, readers match      OK      0       1       1
 *      R: ticket 1, readers match      OK      0       2       2
 *      R: ticket 2, readers match      OK      0       3       3
 *      W: ticket 3, writers no match   block   0       3       4
 *      R: ticket 2, unlock                     1       3       4
 *      R: ticket 0, unlock                     2       3       4
 *      R: ticket 1, unlock                     3       3       4
 *      W: ticket 3, writers match      OK      3       3       4
 *
 * Note the writer blocks until 'writers' equals its ticket number and it does
 * not matter if readers unlock in order or not.
 *
 * Readers or writers entering the system after the write lock is queued block,
 * and the next ticket holder (reader or writer) will unblock when the writer
 * unlocks. An example, continuing from the last line of the above example:
 *
 *                                              writers readers next
 *      W: ticket 3, writers match      OK      3       3       4
 *      R: ticket 4, readers no match   block   3       3       5
 *      R: ticket 5, readers no match   block   3       3       6
 *      W: ticket 6, writers no match   block   3       3       7
 *      W: ticket 3, unlock                     4       4       7
 *      R: ticket 4, readers match      OK      4       5       7
 *      R: ticket 5, readers match      OK      4       6       7
 *
 * The 'next' field is a 2-byte value so the available ticket number wraps at
 * 64K requests. If a thread's lock request is not granted until the 'next'
 * field cycles and the same ticket is taken by another thread, we could grant
 * a lock to two separate threads at the same time, and bad things happen: two
 * writer threads or a reader thread and a writer thread would run in parallel,
 * and lock waiters could be skipped if the unlocks race. This is unlikely, it
 * only happens if a lock request is blocked by 64K other requests. The fix is
 * to grow the lock structure fields, but the largest atomic instruction we have
 * is 8 bytes, the structure has no room to grow.
