This directory contains reimplementation of some of the hpx test codes in 
a variety of concurrent languages and environments: java, chapel, pthreads, 
cilk, etc. This is intended for performance comparisons between "our" and 
"their" version of functionally equivalent codes (at least as close as we 
can get), which potentially could point out inefficiencies and bugs in 
our system.

fibonacci
---------
fib.chpl: chapel version, currently compiles with version 0.8 of the
chapel compiler. Performs one calculation per run. The argument value 
can be modified on the command line by using "--v=<number>" switch.

Fib2.java: performs 10 tests per invocation, reporting _average_ of all
previous and current timings in each iteration. Garbage collector is 
invoked at the end of each iteration (but not timed) to avoid pollution 
from previous runs. Takes one integer as command line argument.

pfib.c: simple pthread implementation; utilizes all cores on the node. 
Switch "-s" forces allocation of minimal stacks on systems that support 
this attribute (frequently results in order of magnitude speedups). 
Also, additional performance boost can be obtained by specifying 
"limit stacksize unlimited" on csh-compatible shells, or "ulimit -s 
unlimited" on bash before the execution. Switch "-v <number>" changes  
the argument. Note: use "-lpthread -lrt" to link on Linux.

pfibaff.c: as "pfib.c", but with forced thread affinity. Option "-t 
<number>" will cause the program to use only the first <number> of cores 
available on the system. The threads are assigned to cores based on the 
value of the thread input argument modulo <number>.
