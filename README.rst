 HPX
*****

HPX is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed
applications of any scale. Even if that's quite a mouthful, we mean every
word of it!

The goal of HPX is to create a high quality, freely available, open source
implementation of the ParalleX model for conventional systems, such as
classic Linux based Beowulf clusters or multi-socket highly parallel SMP
nodes. At the same time, we want to have a very modular and well designed
runtime system architecture which would allow us to port our implementation
onto new computer system architectures. We want to use real world applications
to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out required
functionalities and converging onto a stable API which will provide a
smooth migration path for developers. The API exposed by HPX is modelled
after the interfaces defined by the C++11/14 ISO standard and adheres to the
programming guidelines used by the Boost collection of C++ libraries. We
aim improve the scalability of today's applications and to expose new
levels of parallelism which are necessary to take advantage
of the exascale systems of the future.

****************************
What's so special about HPX?
****************************

* HPX exposes an uniform, standards-oriented API for ease of programming
  parallel and distributed applications.
* It enables programmers to write fully asynchronous  code using hundreds
  of millions of threads.
* HPX provides unified syntax and semantics for local and remote operations.
* HPX makes concurrency manageable with dataflow and future based
  synchronization.
* It implements a rich set of runtime services supporting a broad range of
  use cases.
* HPX exposes a uniform, flexible, and extendable performance counter
  framework which can enable runtime adaptivity
* It is designed to solve problems conventionally considered to be
  scaling-impaired.
* HPX has been designed and developed for systems of any scale, from
  hand-held devices to very large scale systems.
* It is the first fully functional implementation of the ParalleX execution
  model.
* HPX is published under a liberal open-source license and has an open,
  active, and thriving developer community.

Linux
-----

1)  Before starting to build HPX, please read about the
    `prerequisites <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/prerequisites.html>`_.

2) Clone the master HPX git repository (or a stable tag)::

    git clone git://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx.git

3) Create a build directory. HPX requires an out-of-tree build. This means you
   will be unable to run CMake in the HPX source directory::

      cd hpx
      mkdir my_hpx_build
      cd my_hpx_build

4) Invoke CMake from your build directory, pointing the CMake driver to the root
   of your HPX source tree::

      cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/your_boost_directory \
            -DHWLOC_ROOT=/your_hwloc_directory \
            [other CMake variable definitions] \
            /path/to/hpx/source/tree

   for instance::

      cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=~/packages/boost \
            -DHWLOC_ROOT=/packages/hwloc \
            -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/packages/hpx \
            ~/downloads/hpx_0.9.11

5) Invoke GNU make. If you are on a machine with multiple cores (very likely),
   add the -jN flag to your make invocation, where N is the number of cores
   on your machine plus one::

      gmake -j5

6) To complete the build and install HPX::

      gmake install

   This will build and install the essential core components of HPX only. Use::

      gmake tests

   to build and run the tests and::

      gmake examples
      gmake install

   to build and install the examples.

Please refer `here <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/building_hpx/build_recipes.html#hpx.manual.build_system.building_hpx.build_recipes.unix_installation>`_
for more information about building HPX on a Linux system.

OS X (Mac)
----------

1)  Before starting to build HPX, please read about the
    `prerequisites <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/prerequisites.html>`_.

2) Clone the master HPX git repository (or a stable tag)::

    git clone git://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx.git

3) Create a build directory. HPX requires an out-of-tree build. This means you
   will be unable to run CMake in the HPX source directory::

      cd hpx
      mkdir my_hpx_build
      cd my_hpx_build

4) Invoke CMake from your build directory, pointing the CMake driver to the root
   of your HPX source tree::

      cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++ \
            -DBOOST_ROOT=/your_boost_directory    \
            [other CMake variable definitions]    \
            /path/to/hpx/source/tree

   for instance::

      cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++ \
            -DBOOST_ROOT=~/packages/boost \
            -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/packages/hpx \
            ~/downloads/hpx_0.9.11

5) Invoke GNU make. If you are on a machine with multiple cores (very likely),
   add the -jN flag to your make invocation, where N is the number of cores
   on your machine plus one::

      make -j5

6) To complete the build and install HPX::

      make install

   This will build and install the essential core components of HPX only. Use::

   to build and run the tests and::

      make examples
      make install

   to build and install the examples.

For more information and additional options, please see the corresponding
`documentation <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/building_hpx/build_recipes.html#hpx.manual.build_system.building_hpx.build_recipes.macos_installation>`_.

Windows
-------

1)  Before starting to build HPX, please read about the
    `prerequisites <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/prerequisites.html>`_.

2) Clone the master HPX git repository (or a stable tag). You can use
   TortoiseGIT, or the git client that Cygwin provides. The git repository can
   be found at::

    git://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx.git

3) Create a build folder. HPX requires an out-of-tree-build. This means that you
   will be unable to run CMake in the HPX source folder.

4) Open up the CMake GUI. In the input box labelled "Where is the source code:",
   enter the full path to the source folder. In the input box labelled
   "Where to build the binaries:", enter the full path to the build folder you
   created in step 2.

5) Add CMake variable definitions (if any) by clicking the "Add Entry" button and selecting type
   "String". Most probably you will need to at least add the directories where `Boost <http://www.boost.org>`_
   is located as BOOST_ROOT and where `Hwloc <http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/>`_ is
   located as HWLOC_ROOT.

6) Press the "Configure" button. A window will pop up asking you which compiler
   to use. Select the x64 Visual Studio 2012 compiler. Note that while it is possible to build HPX for x86
   we don't recommend doing so as 32 bit runs are severely restricted by a 32 bit
   Windows system limitation affecting the number of HPX threads you can create.

7) If the "Generate" button is not clickable, press "Configure" again. Repeat
   this step until the "Generate" button becomes clickable.

8) Press "Generate".

9) Open up the build folder, and double-click hpx.sln.

10) Build the INSTALL target.

For more information, please see the corresponding
`section in the documentation <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/building_hpx/build_recipes.html#hpx.manual.build_system.building_hpx.build_recipes.windows_installation>`_

BlueGene/Q
----------

So far we only support BGClang for compiling HPX on the BlueGene/Q.

1)  Before starting to build HPX, please read about the
    `prerequisites <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/prerequisites.html>`_.

2) Check if BGClang is available on your installation. If not obtain and install a copy
   from the `BGClang trac page <https://trac.alcf.anl.gov/projects/llvm-bgq>`_

3) Build (and install) a recent version of `Hwloc <http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/>`_
   With the following commands::

    ./configure \
          --host=powerpc64-bgq-linux \
          --prefix=$HOME/install/hwloc \
          --disable-shared \
          --enable-static \
          CPPFLAGS='-I/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor ' \
                   '-I/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/spi/include/kernel/cnk/'
    make
    make install

4) Build (and install) a recent version of Boost, using BGClang::
   To build Boost with BGClang, you'll need to set up the following in your Boost
   ``~/user-config.jam`` file::

      # user-config.jam (put this file into your home directory)
      using clang
        :
        : bgclang++11
        :
        ;

   You can then use this as your build command::

        ./bootstrap.sh
        ./b2 --build-dir=/tmp/build-boost --layout=versioned toolset=clang -j12

5) Clone the master HPX git repository (or a stable tag)::

    git clone git://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx.git

6) Generate the HPX buildfiles using cmake::

    cmake -DHPX_PLATFORM=BlueGeneQ \
          -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/hpx/cmake/toolchains/BGQ.cmake \
          -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=bgclang++11 \
          -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=mpiclang++11 \
          -DHWLOC_ROOT=/path/to/hwloc/installation \
          -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost \
          -DHPX_MALLOC=system \
          /path/to/hpx

7) To complete the build and install HPX::

    make -j24
    make install

   This will build and install the essential core components of HPX only. Use::

    make -j24 examples
    make -j24 install

   to build and install the examples.

You can find more details about using HPX on a BlueGene/Q system
`here <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/building_hpx/build_recipes.html#hpx.manual.build_system.building_hpx.build_recipes.bgq_installation>`_.

Intel(R) Xeon/Phi
-----------------

After installing Boost and HWLOC, the build procedure is almost the same as
for how to build HPX on Unix Variants with the sole difference that you have
to enable the Xeon Phi in the CMake Build system. This is achieved by invoking
CMake in the following way::

    cmake \
         -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/hpx/cmake/toolchains/XeonPhi.cmake \
         -DBOOST_ROOT=$BOOST_ROOT \
         -DHWLOC_ROOT=$HWLOC_ROOT \
         /path/to/hpx

For more detailed information about building HPX for the Xeon/Phi please refer to
the `documentation <http://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/html/hpx/manual/build_system/building_hpx/build_recipes.html#hpx.manual.build_system.building_hpx.build_recipes.intel_mic_installation>`_.



******************
 Docker
******************

We also provide several HPX docker images.
Those can be used for rapid prototyping, demonstrations or writing minimal
examples for issue reports. This also provides an HPX build environment for
continuous integration of external projects.

The following images are currently available:

* ``stellargroup/hpx:dev``      (HEAD, updated on every commit to master which
  builds successfully, see
  `here <https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/tree/master>`_ for the
  build status)
* ``stellargroup/hpx:latest``   (latest release)
* ``stellargroup/hpx:0.9.11``   (release v0.9.11)
* ``stellargroup/hpx:0.9.10``   (release v0.9.10)

While a more detailed introduction to docker can be found at the official
`docker homepage <https://docs.docker.com/userguide/>`_, here are some easy
steps that explain how to use a docker image::

    # Download/Update the image
    docker pull stellargroup/hpx:dev

    # Run a command.
    # NOTICE: Docker images are read-only and will be reset after execution.
    docker run stellargroup/hpx:dev hello_world

    # Mount a host directory to make changes persistent.
    # In this case, mount the current host directory $PWD to /hpx in the
    # dockerfile via '-v'.
    # Also, make /hpx the current working directory with '-w'.
    docker run -v $PWD:/hpx -w /hpx stellargroup/hpx:dev <command> <arguments>

    # For example, build the binary "example" from "example.cpp" using
    # the built-in hpx compilation script "hpxcxx". Note that hpx libraries
    # other than the core library have to be linked explicitly (like hpx_iostreams).
    docker run -v $PWD:/hpx -w /hpx stellargroup/hpx:dev \
        hpxcxx example.cpp --exe=example -lhpx_iostreams

    # Now run the resulting program:
    docker run -v $PWD:/hpx -w /hpx stellargroup/hpx:dev ./example
