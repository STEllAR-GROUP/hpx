Prerequisites:  threadsafe HDF5 with fortran and c++ bindings and a fortran compiler.

This is a port of the fortran-90 GTC to HPX by Matt Anderson (anderson.matthew.w@gmail.com)
assisted by Hartmut Kaiser (hartmut.kaiser@gmail.com).
Every effort will be made to keep this code functional as HPX continues to evolve.

Two parameter files are included: gtc.input.64p and gtc.input.512p.
The code looks for a parameter file called gtc.input  -- if it is not
available, then default parameters will run.

There is only one command line option: --os_factor.  This is the oversubscription factor; 
it gives the number of HPX-threads you would like to run per locality.  The larger this number,
the finer grain the computation. 

The GTC code base was GTC_nersc6.  However, it was modified in order to become thread safe.
