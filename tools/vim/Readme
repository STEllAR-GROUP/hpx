Automatically export configuration file for VIM plugin YouCompleteMe:
https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe

Installation:
https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe

Configuration:
Configure hpx build by enabling an option HPX_WITH_VIM_YCM.
File will be configured to use HPX compilation flags and
placed in build directory. To enable support, run 'make configure_ycm' to copy YCM configuration file
from build to source directory. Please note that this will overwrite existing configuration files which might
have been created by other builds using the same source tree.
To avoid asking for confirmation and automatically load config file
add this information to your .vimrc file:
let g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist = ['LOCATION_OF_HPX_SOURCE_TREE/*']

YCM uses compilation flags exported by CMake in build directory. Do not remove
compile_commands.json!
