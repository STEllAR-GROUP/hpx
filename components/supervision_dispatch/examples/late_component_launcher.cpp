// The root side of the supervision_dispatch "late component" demo: this binary
// is the only one of the family that ever runs standalone (as locality 0). It
// spawns late_component_worker/late_component_failing_worker/
// late_component_aborting_worker on demand via
// hpx::components::process::execute() -- mirroring the connect-back pattern
// used by launch_process.cpp
// (libs/full/runtime_components/tests/unit/components/launch_process.cpp) and
// os_assigned_parcelport_port_7406.cpp
// (libs/full/agas/tests/regressions/os_assigned_parcelport_port_7406.cpp) --
// each spawned worker then joins this root under supervision_dispatch and polls
// until root goes silent or it idles out (see late_component_worker.cpp for
// that side of the story).
//
// Task 4a: spawn_worker()/worker_slot/task are the scaffolding every later task
// builds on: spawn_worker() launches one worker process, waits for it to
// connect and join, creates a late_component::test_client instance on its
// locality (the actual unit of dispatchable work -- see
// late_component_worker.hpp), and returns a worker_slot bundling the peer, the
// instance, and everything needed to fence/dispatch against it later.
// worker_slot deliberately does not embed a raw queued-task counter: whether a
// slot still has queued work is always recomputed by scanning `queue` itself
// (see the "any_of" check below), so nothing needs to be kept in sync across a
// respawn.
//
// Task 4b: the dispatch loop below pops tasks off `queue`, dispatches each via
// hpx::supervision::dispatch_work<set_message_action>() fenced against the
// task's worker_slot, and reacts to hpx::error::target_fenced by dropping the
// fenced slot (never reusing its epoch); if HPX_HAVE_FORCE_DISCONNECT is
// enabled, it then purges the fenced locality's leftover AGAS/connection-cache
// state via hpx::force_disconnect() before respawning a fresh worker in the
// slot's place (same variant, brand-new locality/component/epoch), and retrying
// the task -- up to a capped number of retries, past which the task is dropped
// with a logged failure instead (each of detect/purge/relaunch logs its own
// line to make the sequence observable). On success, if no other queued task
// still targets the same slot, a per-worker shutdown signal is sent and the
// slot is retired.
//
// Explicit non-goals, deferred to Task 4c:
//   - No full-queue-drain detection across *all* worker slots.
//   - No error handling for spawn_worker() itself throwing (e.g. process launch
//     failure) -- this is assumed to succeed throughout.
//
// Shutdown-signal convention introduced here: there is no supervision_dispatch
// primitive that lets one peer forcibly latch a terminal event for another
// (publish_event() in dispatch_api.hpp always targets the caller's *own* handle
// -- see its doc comments), and late_component_worker.cpp's own poll loop is
// explicitly local-only (idle-timeout/root-fencing, never a message from root
// -- see the file comment there). So "send the per-worker shutdown signal"
// below means: dispatch a well-known sentinel payload
// (shutdown_sentinel_message) via the ordinary set_message_action to the
// worker_slot's component_id, purely as an observable "root considers this
// worker done" marker (visible via get_message()), and otherwise drop the slot
// from root's own active set. It does not, by itself, hasten the spawned worker
// process's own exit -- that remains governed entirely by its own idle-timeout
// as documented in late_component_worker.cpp.
