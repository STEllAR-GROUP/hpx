collectives
===========

The collectives module exposes a set of distributed collective operations. Those
can be used to exchange data between participating sites in a coordinated way.
At this point the module exposes the following collective primitives:

* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::all_gather`: receives a set of values from all
  participating sites.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::all_reduce`: performs a reduction on data from
  each participating site to each participating site.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::all_to_all`: each participating site provides its
  element of the data to collect while all participating sites receive the data
  from every other site.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::broadcast_to` and
  :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::broadcast_from`: performs a broadcast operation
  from a root site to all participating sites.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::exclusive_scan`: performs an exclusive scan operation
  on a set of values received from all call sites operating on the given base name.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::gather_here` and
  :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::gather_there`: gathers values from all
  participating sites.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::inclusive_scan`: performs an inclusive scan operation
  on a set of values received from all call sites operating on the given base name.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::reduce_here` and
  :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::reduce_there`: performs a reduction on data from each
  participating site to a root site.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::scatter_to` and
  :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::scatter_from`: receives an element of a set of values
  operating on the given base name.

* :cpp:func:`hpx::lcos::broadcast`: performs a given action on all given global
  identifiers.
* :cpp:class:`hpx::distributed::barrier`: distributed barrier.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::lcos::fold`: performs a fold with a given action on all given
  global identifiers.
* :cpp:class:`hpx::distributed::latch`: distributed latch.
* :cpp:func:`hpx::lcos::reduce`: performs a reduction on data from each
  given global identifiers.
* :cpp:class:`hpx::lcos::spmd_block`: performs the same operation on a local
  image while providing handles to the other images.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_collectives_api>` of the module for more
details.

Hierarchical collectives
------------------------

Hierarchical communicators split a collective into sub-communicators arranged as
a tree. This reduces the number of participants in each individual operation,
but it also means that one user-visible hierarchical call can touch several
internal communicators.

Generation model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hierarchical collectives use two internal generations for each user generation.
For a user generation ``k``, the first internal phase uses ``2k - 1`` and the
second uses ``2k``. Single-pass hierarchical operations and the inter-group
exchange of :cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::all_to_all` advance the communicator by
two generations in one step so that shared hierarchical communicators stay
aligned with two-phase collectives.

When a hierarchical communicator instance is shared between collective
operations, callers must pass explicit, strictly consecutive positive
generation numbers. Two-phase hierarchical collectives, including
:cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::all_gather`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::all_reduce`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::all_to_all`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::inclusive_scan`,
:cpp:func:`hpx::collectives::exclusive_scan`, and
:cpp:class:`hpx::distributed::barrier`, reject the default generation because
their phase generations are derived from the explicit user generation.
