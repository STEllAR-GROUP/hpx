This module provides no functionality in itself. Instead it provides headers
that group together other headers that often appear together. The grouping is
similar to that provided by modules. We intend to deprecate these headers in
favor of `hpx/<modulename>.hpp` headers.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_include_api>` of this module for more
details.
