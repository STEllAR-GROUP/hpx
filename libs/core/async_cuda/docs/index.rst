============
async_cuda
============

This library adds a simple API that enables the user to retrieve a future  from
a cuda stream. Typically, a user may launch one or more kernels and then get a
future from the stream that will become ready when those kernels have completed.
It is important to note that multiple kernels may be launched without fetching a
future, and multiple futures may be obtained from the helper. Please refer to
the unit tests and examples for further examples.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_async_cuda_api>` of this module for more
details.
