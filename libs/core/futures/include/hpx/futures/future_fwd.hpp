    ///     that asynchronous operation.
    ///   - The creator of the asynchronous operation can then use a variety of

    ///     provided a value.
    ///   - When the asynchronous operation is ready to send a result to the
    ///     creator, it can do so by modifying shared state (e.g.
    ///     hpx::promise::set_value) that is linked to the creator's hpx::future.
