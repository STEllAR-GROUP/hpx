    /// \brief A semaphore is a protected variable (an entity storing a
    ///        value) or abstract data type (an entity grouping several
    ///        variables that may or may not be numerical) which
    ///        constitutes the classic method for restricting access to
    ///        shared resources, such as shared memory, in a
    ///        multiprogramming environment. Semaphores exist in many
    ///        variants, though usually the term refers to a counting
    ///        semaphore, since a binary semaphore is better known as a
    ///        mutex. A counting semaphore is a counter for a set of
    ///        available resources, rather than a locked/unlocked flag of a
    ///        single resource. It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra.
    ///        Semaphores are the classic solution to preventing race
    ///        conditions in the dining philosophers problem, although they
    ///        do not prevent resource deadlocks.
    ///
    ///        Counting semaphores can be used for synchronizing multiple
    ///        threads as well: one thread waiting for several other
    ///        threads to touch (signal) the semaphore, or several threads
    ///        waiting for one other thread to touch this semaphore. Unlike
    ///        \a hpx::mutex a \a counting_semaphore is not tied to threads
    ///        of execution -- acquiring a semaphore can occur on a
    ///        different thread than releasing the semaphore, for example.
    ///        All operations on \a counting_semaphore can be performed
    ///        concurrently and without any relation to specific threads of
    ///        execution, with the exception of the destructor which cannot
    ///        be performed concurrently but can be performed on a different
    ///        thread.
    ///
    ///        Semaphores are lightweight synchronization primitives used
    ///        to constrain concurrent access to a shared resource. They
    ///        are widely used to implement other synchronization
