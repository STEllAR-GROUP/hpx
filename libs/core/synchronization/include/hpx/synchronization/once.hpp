    /// \brief   Executes the Callable object \a f exactly once, even if called
    ///          concurrently, from several threads.
    /// \details In detail:
    ///          - If, by the time \a call_once is called, flag indicates that
    ///            \a f was already called, \a call_once returns right away
    ///            (such a call to \a call_once is known as passive).
    ///          - Otherwise, \a call_once invokes \c std::forward<Callable>(f)
    ///            with the arguments \c std::forward<Args>(args)... (as if by
    ///            \c hpx::invoke). Unlike the \c hpx::thread constructor or
    ///            \c hpx::async, the arguments are not moved or copied because
    ///            they don't need to be transferred to another thread of
    ///            execution. (such a call to \a call_once is known as active).
    ///             - If that invocation throws an exception, it is propagated
    ///               to the caller of \a call_once, and the flag is not flipped
    ///               so that another call will be attempted (such a call to \a
    ///               call_once is known as exceptional).
    ///             - If that invocation returns normally (such a call to \a
    ///               call_once is known as returning), the flag is flipped, and
    ///               all other calls to \a call_once with the same flag are
    ///               guaranteed to be passive.
    ///          All active calls on the same flag form a single total order
    ///          consisting of zero or more exceptional calls, followed by one
    ///          returning call. The end of each active call synchronizes-with
    ///          the next active call in that order. The return from the
    ///          returning call synchronizes-with the returns from all passive
    ///          calls on the same flag: this means that all concurrent calls to
    ///          \a call_once are guaranteed to observe any side-effects made by
    ///             the
    ///          active call, with no additional synchronization.
