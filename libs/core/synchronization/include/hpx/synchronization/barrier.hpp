    ///     completion step is run on one of the threads that arrived at the
    ///     barrier during the phase.
    ///   - When the completion step finishes, the expected count is reset to
    ///     what was specified by the expected argument to the constructor,
    ///     possibly adjusted by calls to arrive_and_drop, and the next phase
    ///     starts.
