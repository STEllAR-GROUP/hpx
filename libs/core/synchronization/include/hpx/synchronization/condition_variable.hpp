    /// \brief The \a condition_variable class is a synchronization primitive that
    /// can be used to block a thread, or multiple threads at the same time,
    /// until another thread both modifies a shared variable (the condition),
    /// and notifies the \a condition_variable.
    ///
    /// The thread that intends to modify the shared variable has to
    ///      1. acquire a \a hpx::mutex (typically via \a std::lock_guard)
    ///      2. perform the modification while the lock is held
    ///      3. execute \a notify_one or \a notify_all on the
    ///         condition_variable (the lock does not need to be held for
    ///         notification)
    ///
    /// Even if the shared variable is atomic, it must be modified under the mutex
    /// in order to correctly publish the modification to the waiting thread.
    /// Any thread that intends to wait on \a condition_variable has to
    ///      1. acquire a \a std::unique_lock<hpx::mutex>, on the same mutex as
    ///         used to protect the shared variable
    ///      2. either
    ///          1. check the condition, in case it was already updated and
    ///             notified
    ///          2. execute \a wait, \a await_for, or \a wait_until. The wait
    ///             operations atomically release the mutex and suspend the
    ///             execution
    ///             of the thread.
    ///          3. When the condition variable is notified, a timeout expires, or
    ///             a spurious wakeup occurs, the thread is awakened, and the
    ///             mutex is atomically reacquired. The thread should then check
    ///             the condition and resume waiting if the wake up was spurious.
    ///          or
