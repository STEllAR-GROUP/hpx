tracing
=======

This module provides the |hpx| tracing abstraction: a compile-time-dispatched
API that annotates |hpx| runtime events (task lifecycle, futures, parcels, work
stealing, worker sleep, and more) and routes those annotations to a single
profiler backend selected at build time.

Four backends are supported, one at a time:

* :ref:`modules_tracy` — the |tracy|_ profiler, enabled with
  :option:`HPX_WITH_TRACY`.
* |ittnotify|_, enabled with :option:`HPX_WITH_ITTNOTIFY`.
* |apex|_, enabled with :option:`HPX_WITH_APEX`.
* an empty backend when none of the above is enabled — the C++ hooks are
  ``constexpr`` no-ops and the tracing macros expand to nothing, so every
  entry compiles out at zero runtime cost.

The public entry points live in ``hpx/tracing/backends/{empty,ittnotify,apex,tracy}.hpp``
and are all under the ``hpx::tracing`` namespace. The dispatch macros
(``HPX_TRACING_MARK_EVENT``, ``HPX_TRACING_ZONE``, ``HPX_TRACING_PAUSE``,
``HPX_TRACING_RESUME``) live in ``hpx/tracing/macros.hpp``.

See :ref:`optimizing_with_tracy` for how to build |hpx| against Tracy and
attach the profiler.
