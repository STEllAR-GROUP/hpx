This module implements the ``prefer`` customization point for properties in
terms of |p2220|_. This differs from |p1393|_ in that it relies fully on
``tag_invoke`` overloads and fewer base customization points. Actual properties
are defined in modules. All functionality is experimental and can be accessed
through the ``hpx::experimental`` namespace.

See the :ref:`API reference <modules_properties_api>` of this module for more
details.
