Resiliency
==========

In HPX, a program failure is a manifestation of a failing task. This module
exposes several APIs that allow to manage failing tasks in a convenient way by
either replaying a failed task or by replicating a specific task to begin with.

Task replay is analogous to the Checkpoint/Restart mechanism found in conventional
execution models. The key difference being localized fault detection. When the
runtime detects an error it replays the failing task as opposed to completely
rolling back of the entire program to the previous checkpoint.

Task replication is designed to provide reliability enhancements by replicating
a set of tasks and evaluating their results to determine a consensus among them.
This technique is most effective in situations where there are few tasks in the
critical path of the DAG which leaves the system underutilized or where hardware
or software failures may result in an incorrect result instead of an error.
However, the drawback of this method is the additional computational cost incurred
by repeating a task multiple times.


The following API functions are exposed:

- `hpx::resiliency::async_replay`: This version of task replay will catch user
  defined exceptions and automatically reschedule the task N times before
  throwing an `hpx::resiliency::abort_replay_exception` if no task is able to
  complete execution without an exception.

- `hpx::resiliency::async_replay_validate`: This version of replay adds an
  argument to async replay which receives a user provided validation function
  to test the result of the task against. If the task's output is validated,
  the result is returned. If the output fails the check or an exception is
  thrown, the task is replayed until no errors are encountered or the number of
  specified retries have been exceeded.

- `hpx::resiliency::async_replicate`: This is the most basic implementation of
  the task replication. The API returns the first result that runs without
  detecting any errors.

- `hpx::resiliency::async_replicate_validate`: This API additionally takes a
  validation function which evaluates the return values produced by the threads.
  The first task to compute a valid result is returned.

- `hpx::resiliency::async_replicate_vote`: This API adds a vote function to the
  basic replicate function. Many hardware or software failures are silent errors
  which do not interrupt program flow. In order to detect errors of this kind,
  it is necessary to run the task several times and compare the values returned
  by every version of the task. In order to determine which return value is
  "correct", the API allow the user to provide a custom consensus function to
  properly form a consensus. This voting function then returns the "correct""
  answer.

- `hpx::resiliency::async_replicate_vote_validate`: This combines the features
  of the previously discussed replicate set. Replicate vote validate allows a
  user to provide a validation function to filter results. Additionally, as
  described in replicate vote, the user can provide a "voting function" which
  returns the consensus formed by the voting logic.

- `hpx::resiliency::dataflow_replay`: This version of dataflow replay will catch
  user defined exceptions and automatically reschedules the task N times before
  throwing an `hpx::resiliency::abort_replay_exception` if no task is able to
  complete execution without an exception. Any arguments for the executed task
  that are futures will cause the task invocation to be delayed until all of
  those futures have become ready.

- `hpx::resiliency::dataflow_replay_validate` : This version of replay adds an
  argument to dataflow replay which receives a user provided validation function
  to test the result of the task against. If the task's output is validated,
  the result is returned. If the output fails the check or an exception is
  thrown, the task is replayed until no errors are encountered or the number of
  specified retries have been exceeded. Any arguments for the executed task
  that are futures will cause the task invocation to be delayed until all of
  those futures have become ready.

- `hpx::resiliency::datafloe_replicate`: This is the most basic implementation of
  the task replication. The API returns the first result that runs without
  detecting any errors. Any arguments for the executed task that are futures will
  cause the task invocation to be delayed until all of those futures have become
  ready.

- `hpx::resiliency::datafloe_replicate_validate`: This API additionally takes a
  validation function which evaluates the return values produced by the threads.
  The first task to compute a valid result is returned. Any arguments for the
