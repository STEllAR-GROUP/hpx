Overview
========

|hpx| is organized into different sub-libraries. Those libraries can be seen as
independent modules, with clear dependencies and no cycles. As an end-user, the
use of these modules is completely transparent. If you use e.g.
``add_hpx_executable`` to create a target in your project you will automatically
get all modules as dependencies. See :ref:`all_modules` for a list of the
available modules.
