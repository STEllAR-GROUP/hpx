The module program_options is a direct fork of the Boost.ProgramOptions library
(Boost V1.70.0). For more information about this library please see `here
<https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/doc/html/program_options.html>`__. 
In order to be included as an HPX module, the Boost.ProgramOptions library has 
been moved to the ``namespace hpx::program_options``. We have also replaced all
Boost facilities the library depends on with either the equivalent facilities 
from the standard library or from HPX. As a result, the HPX program_options module
is fully interface compatible with Boost.ProgramOptions (sans the ``hpx`` 
namespace and the ``#include <hpx/program_options.hpp>`` changes that need to be 
applied to all code relying on this library.

All credit goes to Vladimir Prus, the author of the excellent Boost.ProgramOptions 
library. All bugs have been introduced by us.
